**Metacognitive Trigger**: Before claiming ANY production readiness

---

## ü§ù AGENT COORDINATION RULES

1. ALWAYS use specialized agents for complex tasks (3+ steps)
2. SPAWN agents based on task pattern recognition matrix (.claude/CLAUDE.md)
3. COORDINATE using hierarchical topology for enterprise LMS features
4. VALIDATE agent outputs against constitutional rules

---

## üéØ VIBE_CHECK DECISION CHECKPOINTS

**ALWAYS use `vibe_check` before:**

- Adding new React contexts (11+ already exist - verify necessity)
- Creating new database tables or RLS policies (security impact)
- Modifying assessment scoring algorithms (learning science integrity)
- Changing spaced repetition logic (research-backed intervals)
- Adding new external dependencies (bundle size impact)
- Making architectural changes (over-engineering risk)
- Deploying to production (readiness verification)
- Modifying authentication/authorization (security critical)

**Example Usage**:
```javascript
vibe_check({
  context: "User wants to add new feature X",
  assumptions: ["Assumption 1", "Assumption 2"],
  decision: "Proposed implementation approach"
})
```

---

## üîÑ VIBE_LEARN PATTERN LEARNING

**ALWAYS use `vibe_learn` for:**

- TypeScript errors and their resolutions
- Common accessibility violations and fixes
- Performance bottlenecks and optimization solutions
- Security vulnerabilities and patches
- Testing failures and debugging strategies
- Deployment issues and rollback procedures

**Example Usage**:
```javascript
vibe_learn({
  error: "Description of the error encountered",
  solution: "How it was resolved",
  pattern: "General pattern to prevent recurrence",
  category: "typescript-strict-mode | accessibility | security | performance"
})
```

## üê≥ MCP DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY (PHASED APPROACH)

**Current Phase:** PHASE 1 - Hybrid Architecture (as of 2025-10-08)
**Future Phase:** PHASE 2 - Full Docker Containerization (post-production launch)

### PHASE 1: Hybrid Architecture (CURRENT)

**Status**: Production Preparation
**Strategy**: Minimize complexity during launch, containerize only critical infrastructure

**MCP Transport Methods:**

| MCP Server | Transport | Rationale |
|------------|-----------|-----------|
| sqlite-tanium | **Docker** | Database isolation, backup automation, resource limits |
| shadcn | npx | Dev tool, well-maintained, low risk |
| filesystem | npx | Local file access, minimal overhead |
| claude-flow | npx | Agent coordination, performance critical |
| github | npx | Official MCP, well-maintained |
| firecrawl | npx | Web scraping, official MCP |
| playwright | npx | Browser automation, official MCP |
| postgresql | Docker | Production Supabase (already containerized) |
| vibe-check | HTTP (remote) | Smithery-hosted, no local install |

**Why Hybrid Now?**
1. ‚úÖ Production preparation phase - minimize risk
2. ‚úÖ Just optimized to 61% context reduction - don't add complexity
3. ‚úÖ Official npx MCPs are well-maintained and performant
4. ‚úÖ Database isolation where it matters most (sqlite-tanium, postgresql)
5. ‚úÖ Focus on content population, testing, deployment

**Performance Impact:** <5ms latency for Docker MCPs, 0ms for npx

### PHASE 2: Full Docker Containerization (POST-LAUNCH)

**Timeline**: 1-2 months after production launch
**Scope**: Containerize all 8 MCP servers
**Rationale**: Long-term enterprise infrastructure alignment

**Why Full Docker Later?**
1. ‚úÖ **Industry Standard** - Docker MCP Catalog is official distribution (July 2025)
2. ‚úÖ **MCP Registry** - 2026 roadmap includes centralized discovery (Docker Hub integration)
3. ‚úÖ **Enterprise LMS** - Containerization expected for enterprise-grade systems
4. ‚úÖ **Security Compliance** - Audit requirements (signatures, SBOMs, attestations)
5. ‚úÖ **Scaling** - Resource limits, isolation needed beyond pilot users
6. ‚úÖ **Reference Implementations** - Docker is the MCP standard deployment

**Expected Benefits:**
- Security: Fine-grained resource limits, network isolation
- Reliability: Health checks, auto-restart, rollback capabilities
- Scalability: Kubernetes-ready, horizontal scaling
- Compliance: SBOM generation, vulnerability scanning (Grype/Syft)

### MCP DECISION CHECKPOINTS

**ALWAYS use `vibe_check` BEFORE:**
- Changing MCP transport methods (npx ‚Üî Docker)
- Adding new MCP servers
- Modifying docker-compose.yml for MCP services
- Production MCP deployment
- Updating MCP server versions
- Changing MCP configuration (env vars, args)

**Example `vibe_check` Usage:**
```javascript
mcp__pv-bhat-vibe-check-mcp-server__vibe_check({
  context: "User wants to containerize firecrawl MCP before production launch",
  assumptions: [
    "Containerization improves security",
    "All MCPs should be Docker",
    "This won't delay production launch"
  ],
  decision: "Create Dockerfile for firecrawl and update .mcp.json"
})

// EXPECTED RESPONSE:
// ‚ö†Ô∏è Question: Is this aligned with PHASE 1 hybrid strategy?
// ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenge: Will this delay production content population work?
// ‚ö†Ô∏è Verify: Check constitutional rules - PHASE 2 is post-launch
// ‚úÖ Recommendation: Keep firecrawl as npx for now, containerize in PHASE 2
```

### PATTERN LEARNING

**ALWAYS use `vibe_learn` AFTER:**
- MCP performance issues (Docker vs npx)
- Docker container debugging
- Transport method failures
- MCP connectivity problems
- Docker image build errors

**Example `vibe_learn` Usage:**
```javascript
mcp__pv-bhat-vibe-check-mcp-server__vibe_learn({
  error: "sqlite-tanium Docker container failed health check",
  solution: "Added DATABASE_PATH env variable and volume mount",
  pattern: "MCP Docker containers need explicit env vars and volume persistence",
  category: "mcp-docker-deployment"
})
```

### ARCHITECTURE ALIGNMENT

**Current Infrastructure:**
- 8 MCP servers: 1 Docker (sqlite-tanium), 7 npx, 1 HTTP remote
- Docker installed: v28.3.3
- Supabase PostgreSQL: Already containerized
- WSL2 environment: Ubuntu on Windows

**Future Infrastructure (Post-Launch):**
- All MCPs containerized in unified docker-compose.yml
- Docker MCP Catalog submission (if custom MCPs developed)
- SBOM generation and vulnerability scanning
- Kubernetes deployment option for scaling

### ROLLBACK PROCEDURE

**If Docker MCP Fails:**
1. Stop Docker container: `docker compose down mcp-sqlite-tanium`
2. Revert .mcp.json to npx transport
3. Clear Docker volumes if database corrupted
4. Restart Claude Code session
5. Verify npx MCP works: Check `.mcp.json` loads correctly

**Rollback File Backup:**
```bash
# Before Docker migration
cp .mcp.json .mcp.json.backup-pre-docker-$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

### MIGRATION TIMELINE

**Immediate (Phase 1):**
- ‚úÖ sqlite-tanium Docker container
- ‚úÖ Docker infrastructure setup
- ‚úÖ Documentation and rollback procedures

**Post-Launch (Phase 2):**
- üîÑ shadcn Docker container
- üîÑ filesystem Docker container
- üîÑ claude-flow Docker container
- üîÑ github Docker container
- üîÑ firecrawl Docker container
- üîÑ playwright Docker container
- üîÑ Unified docker-compose.yml
- üîÑ Security scanning automation

### RED FLAGS (Immediate vibe_check required)

- ‚ùå Containerizing all MCPs before production launch
- ‚ùå Removing npx MCPs without Docker replacement tested
- ‚ùå Modifying production Supabase Docker configuration
- ‚ùå Adding new MCPs without documented rationale
- ‚ùå Skipping health checks for Docker MCPs
- ‚ùå Deploying Docker MCPs without rollback procedure

**Metacognitive Trigger**: Before ANY MCP architectural change

## üéØ CONSTITUTION UPDATE PROTOCOL

**When to update this constitution:**

1. New production priority identified
2. Critical security pattern discovered
3. Recurring error pattern needs codification
4. Architecture decision requires enforcement
5. Quality gate needs strengthening

**How to update:**
```bash
# Edit this file
nano .claude/vibe-check-constitution.md

# Reload in next session, or use:
mcp__pv-bhat-vibe-check-mcp-server__reset_constitution()
mcp__pv-bhat-vibe-check-mcp-server__update_constitution({
  rule: "Updated rule content"
})
```
