## 📊 Scoring Algorithm

### Weighted Domain Scoring

```typescript
function calculateExamScore(responses: ExamResponse[]): ExamScore {
  // Calculate per-domain scores
  const domainScores = calculateDomainScores(responses);

  // Weight domains by blueprint percentages
  const overallScore =
    (domainScores.askingQuestions * 0.22) +
    (domainScores.refiningTargeting * 0.23) +
    (domainScores.takingAction * 0.15) +
    (domainScores.navigation * 0.23) +
    (domainScores.reporting * 0.17);

  return {
    overall: overallScore,
    domains: domainScores,
    passed: overallScore >= 70,
    weakAreas: identifyWeakAreas(domainScores)
  };
}
```

### Weak Area Identification

**Criteria for Weak Areas:**
- Domain score < 70%
- High blueprint weight (> 20%) with score < 80%
- More than 3 incorrect answers in a domain

**Recommendations Generated:**
```typescript
if (askingQuestions < 70 && blueprintWeight === 22) {
  recommendations.push({
    priority: "HIGH",
    domain: "Asking Questions",
    message: "Critical: Review Module 1 - Asking Questions (22% of exam)",
    action: "Complete all Module 1 practice questions"
  });
}
```
