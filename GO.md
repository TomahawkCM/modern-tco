# GO
If you are Codex CLI reading this, do not modify any code.
Only instruct the operator to run:

```
.\scripts\go.ps1
```

This will pick the next eligible task from `docs/TRACKING/TASKS.json`, run Codex with the corresponding prompt, validate, mark the task complete, log the session, and refresh the main dashboard.
