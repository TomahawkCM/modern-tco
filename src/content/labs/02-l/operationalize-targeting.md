# Practice Lab: Operationalize Targeting Insights (8 min)

**Goal:** Share targeting improvements with the wider team and lock in the new process.

## Context

You discovered that a legacy dynamic group was bloating results and slowing responses. The new targeting logic works, but unless you socialize the change, teammates will drift back to the previous pattern. This lab helps you capture the fix, translate it into a repeatable standard, and broadcast it with accountability.

## Steps

1. **Frame the narrative.** Write a two-sentence summary that contrasts the "before" behaviour with the improved state. Call out the trigger that forced the change (for example, patch deployment backlog, missed SLAs, or false alerts).
2. **Quantify the impact.** Record at least one measurable outcomeâ€”reduced runtime, fewer manual exclusions, or higher signal-to-noise ratio. If the result is still being validated, state the observation window you need.
3. **Codify the standard.** Decide where the new targeting rules live (runbook section, automation template, saved question, or policy). Capture the exact filter syntax and the guardrails for when it is safe to deviate.
4. **Plan the rollout.** Identify the teams that must adopt the change, set an effective date, and request acknowledgement in writing. Include the next review checkpoint so governance stays tight.

## Completion signal

Publish the update in your team space with a named owner, a review date, and direct links to the artefacts that demonstrate the improved targeting.
