# Practice Lab: Question Performance Diagnostics (6 min)

**Goal:** Capture the key metrics that indicate when a question needs optimization.

## Steps

1. Open Question History for a frequently used query.
2. Record average runtime, max runtime, and recent anomalies.
3. Identify which sensors contribute most to runtime.
4. Suggest one optimization (split question, scoped targeting, or scheduling change).

## Completion signal

Log the optimization recommendation in your operations tracker with an owner and follow-up date.
