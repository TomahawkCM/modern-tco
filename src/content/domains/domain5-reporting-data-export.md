## Practice Questions

### Question 1: Report Template Optimization

**Scenario:** Your organization needs to optimize a daily compliance report that currently takes 45 minutes to generate and frequently times out during peak hours.

**Question:** Which combination of optimization techniques would most effectively reduce report generation time while maintaining data accuracy?

A) Increase server memory allocation and add more processors to handle larger datasets
B) Implement result caching, optimize database queries, and schedule generation during off-peak hours
C) Switch to simplified report formats and reduce the number of data sources included
D) Enable report compression and switch all recipients to email delivery only

**Answer:** B) Implement result caching, optimize database queries, and schedule generation during off-peak hours

**Explanation:** The most effective approach combines technical and operational optimizations. Result caching eliminates redundant calculations, query optimization reduces database load, and off-peak scheduling avoids resource contention. This maintains full data accuracy while significantly improving performance.

### Question 2: Multi-Format Export Strategy

**Scenario:** A multinational organization requires the same security data to be delivered to different stakeholders: executives need visual summaries, analysts need raw data for statistical analysis, and automated systems need structured data feeds.

**Question:** What is the optimal export format strategy for this requirement?

A) PDF for executives, CSV for analysts, JSON for automated systems
B) Excel for executives, XML for analysts, CSV for automated systems  
C) HTML for executives, PDF for analysts, XML for automated systems
D) All stakeholders should use the same format for consistency

**Answer:** A) PDF for executives, CSV for analysts, JSON for automated systems

**Explanation:** This strategy optimally matches format capabilities to user needs: PDF provides professional presentation with charts/formatting for executives, CSV offers raw data perfect for statistical analysis tools, and JSON provides structured data ideal for API consumption by automated systems.

### Question 3: Automated Distribution Failure Recovery

**Scenario:** Your automated security report distribution has been experiencing intermittent failures during the past month, with approximately 15% of reports not reaching their intended recipients due to various network and system issues.

**Question:** Which failure recovery strategy provides the most robust solution while maintaining timely delivery?

A) Increase retry attempts to 10 with 5-minute intervals and disable failure notifications
B) Implement exponential backoff retry (3 attempts: 5, 15, 45 minutes), with alternative delivery methods and admin alerts
C) Switch all delivery to manual distribution to ensure 100% reliability
D) Queue all failed reports for batch delivery at the end of each day

**Answer:** B) Implement exponential backoff retry (3 attempts: 5, 15, 45 minutes), with alternative delivery methods and admin alerts

**Explanation:** Exponential backoff prevents system overload during recovery, alternative delivery methods (email, file share) provide redundancy, and admin alerts ensure prompt intervention when needed. This balances automated recovery with human oversight for optimal reliability.

### Question 4: Data Quality Validation Implementation

**Scenario:** You're implementing automated data quality checks for financial compliance reports that must meet strict accuracy requirements and pass external audits.

**Question:** Which data quality validation approach provides the most comprehensive coverage for compliance requirements?

A) Check for null values and basic format validation only
B) Implement completeness, accuracy, consistency, and timeliness validation with automated alerts
C) Rely on end-user validation and feedback to identify quality issues
D) Use sampling-based validation on 10% of data to reduce processing overhead

**Answer:** B) Implement completeness, accuracy, consistency, and timeliness validation with automated alerts

**Explanation:** Comprehensive validation covering all four data quality dimensions ensures regulatory compliance. Completeness checks for missing data, accuracy validates correctness, consistency ensures uniformity, and timeliness verifies currency. Automated alerts enable rapid response to quality issues.

### Question 5: Performance Optimization for Large Datasets

**Scenario:** Your organization needs to generate weekly reports from a database containing 50 million endpoint records, and current reports are taking over 8 hours to complete, impacting system performance.

**Question:** What combination of techniques would most effectively optimize performance for large dataset reporting?

A) Upgrade to SSD storage and increase RAM to handle entire dataset in memory
B) Implement data indexing, parallel processing, incremental updates, and result caching
C) Reduce report scope to cover only critical systems and decrease data retention period
D) Schedule all reports during maintenance windows when system load is minimal

**Answer:** B) Implement data indexing, parallel processing, incremental updates, and result caching

**Explanation:** This comprehensive approach addresses performance at multiple levels: indexing optimizes database queries, parallel processing leverages multiple CPU cores, incremental updates process only changed data, and caching eliminates redundant calculations. Combined, these techniques can reduce processing time by 80-90% while maintaining full data coverage.
