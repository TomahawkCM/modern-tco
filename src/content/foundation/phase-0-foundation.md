### üèóÔ∏è Foundation Learning Modules

## Module 1: Understanding Endpoint Management (15 minutes)

### What Are Endpoints?
Think of endpoints as **every device** in your organization that connects to the network:
- **Laptops** that employees use daily
- **Desktop computers** in offices
- **Servers** running critical applications
- **Mobile devices** accessing company resources
- **IoT devices** like printers and cameras

### The Endpoint Challenge
Without proper management, IT teams face:
- **"Where is that device?"** - No visibility into what's connected
- **"Is it secure?"** - Unknown vulnerabilities and threats
- **"What's installed?"** - No inventory of software and patches
- **"How do we fix issues?"** - Manual, time-consuming troubleshooting

### How Tanium Solves This
Tanium provides **real-time visibility and control** over all endpoints:
- **See everything** connected to your network instantly
- **Ask questions** about any endpoint in natural language
- **Take actions** to fix issues across thousands of devices simultaneously
- **Stay secure** with continuous monitoring and threat detection
