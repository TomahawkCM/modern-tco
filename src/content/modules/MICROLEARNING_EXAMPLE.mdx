## Natural Language Query Construction

Tanium's revolutionary approach uses **natural language processing** to convert human-readable questions into powerful system queries.

<InfoBox title="Key Insight">
  The Tanium question format follows: **Get [sensor] from [targets] where [filters]**
</InfoBox>

### Basic Query Examples

**Simple Queries** (no filters):
```
Get Computer Name from all machines
Get Operating System from all machines
Get IP Address from all machines
```

**Filtered Queries** (with conditions):
```
Get Running Services from all machines where IP Address contains "192.168"
Get Installed Applications from all machines where Computer Name contains "SERVER"
Get Disk Space from all machines where Free Space is less than 10GB
```

### The Three Query Components

1. **Sensor (What you want to know)**
   - Computer Name
   - Operating System
   - Running Processes
   - Installed Applications
   - 500+ more built-in sensors

2. **Target (Which endpoints to query)**
   - `from all machines` (default)
   - `from Windows Computers`
   - `from Linux Computers`
   - `from Computer Group "Production Servers"`

3. **Filter (Optional conditions)**
   - `where Computer Name contains "PROD"`
   - `where IP Address starts with "10."`
   - `where Operating System contains "Windows 10"`

### Why This Matters

Traditional IT tools require SQL knowledge or complex scripting. Tanium's natural language approach:
- **Reduces learning curve** by 70%
- **Enables non-technical users** to query systems
- **Decreases query construction time** from minutes to seconds
- **Eliminates syntax errors** common with SQL/scripting

## The 500+ Sensor Library

Tanium provides an extensive library of **built-in sensors** organized into four main categories.

### Sensor Categories

#### 1. System Sensors
Core system information available on all endpoints:
- **Computer Name**: Hostname of the endpoint
- **Operating System**: OS version and build
- **IP Address**: Network addressing information
- **Last Logged In User**: Active user account
- **Uptime**: Time since last reboot
- **Domain**: Active Directory domain membership

#### 2. Security Sensors
Security-focused data collection:
- **Running Processes**: Active executables and services
- **Open Ports**: Network listening services
- **User Rights**: Account permissions and privileges
- **Services**: Windows services and their states
- **Firewall Status**: Endpoint firewall configuration
- **Installed Patches**: Update compliance status

#### 3. Application Sensors
Software inventory and status:
- **Installed Applications**: Complete software inventory
- **Running Applications**: Active user applications
- **Browser Extensions**: Chrome, Firefox, Edge extensions
- **Application Version**: Specific version information
- **File Existence**: Check for specific files
- **Registry Keys**: Windows registry values

#### 4. Hardware Sensors
Physical and resource information:
- **CPU Usage**: Processor utilization percentage
- **Memory Usage**: RAM consumption
- **Disk Space**: Storage capacity and free space
- **Network Interface**: Network adapter details
- **Serial Number**: Hardware identification
- **Manufacturer**: Device vendor information

### Using the Sensor Library

**Access in Console**:
1. Click "Ask Question" in Tanium Console
2. Browse "Sensor Library" in left panel
3. Search for sensors by name or category
4. View sensor documentation and examples

**Sensor Documentation Includes**:
- Description and purpose
- Return data format
- Platform compatibility (Windows/Linux/Mac)
- Example queries
- Related sensors

  keyTakeaways={[

  quickCheck={
    <>
      <MicroQuizMDX
        question="What filter operator would you use to find servers with names like 'PROD-WEB-01', 'PROD-WEB-02'?"
        options={[
          "Computer Name equals 'PROD'",
          "Computer Name contains 'PROD'",
          "Computer Name starts with 'PROD'",
          "Computer Name ends with '01'"
        ]}
        correctAnswer="Computer Name starts with 'PROD'"
        explanation="'starts with' is more precise than 'contains' for finding servers with a common naming prefix like 'PROD-'. This avoids matching servers like 'DEV-PROD-TEST' that contain 'PROD' elsewhere in the name."
        concept="Filter Operators"
      />
    </>
  }
>

## Query Filtering Techniques

Filters transform broad queries into precise investigations by reducing result sets to only relevant endpoints.

### Common Filter Operators

| Operator | Use Case | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **contains** | Partial match anywhere in string | `where Computer Name contains "SERVER"` |
| **equals** | Exact match | `where Operating System equals "Windows 10"` |
| **starts with** | Match beginning of string | `where Computer Name starts with "PROD-"` |
| **ends with** | Match end of string | `where Computer Name ends with "-DB"` |
| **is greater than** | Numeric comparison | `where CPU Usage is greater than 80` |
| **is less than** | Numeric comparison | `where Disk Free Space is less than 10GB` |

### Filtering Best Practices

**DO**:
- Use `starts with` for predictable naming patterns
- Use `contains` for flexible matching
- Use numeric operators for performance/capacity monitoring
- Combine filters to narrow results precisely

**DON'T**:
- Over-filter and miss important results
- Use `contains` when `equals` would be more accurate
- Forget about case sensitivity (most operators are case-insensitive)

### Filter Examples

```
# Find Windows servers with low disk space
Get Computer Name from all machines
where Operating System contains "Windows Server"
and Disk Free Space is less than 20GB

# Find production web servers
Get IP Address from all machines
where Computer Name starts with "PROD-WEB"

# Find endpoints with high CPU usage
Get Computer Name from all machines
where CPU Usage is greater than 85
```
