## Supplemental: Data Export Mastery (Advanced)

<InfoBox title="Decision matrix">
  Choose the export format by consumer, schema stability, size, and latency requirements. Use CSV for bulk tabular analysis; JSON for APIs; XLSX for presentation; Parquet/NDJSON for big data.
</InfoBox>

### Format Selection Guide

- CSV: fastest, wide tooling support; watch for commas/encoding
- JSON/NDJSON: hierarchical/streaming; friendly for microservices
- XLSX: formatted consumption; heavier to generate at scale
- Parquet: columnar, highly compressed; best for data lakes/warehouses

### Schema and Mapping

- Define canonical field names and data types; publish a data dictionary
- Use versioned schemas; include `schema_version` in exports
- Map Tanium fields to enterprise domains (CMDB, HR, ITSM)

### API and Streaming Patterns

```console
Export > API > Outbound Setup
1. Select data model (e.g., compliance_summary_v2)
2. Choose format (JSON/NDJSON) and pagination or stream
3. Configure auth (OAuth2/service token) and retries (exponential backoff)
4. Set rate limits and concurrency per endpoint
5. Validate with contract tests against consumer mock
```

### Performance and Partitioning

- Partition by date/site/BU for parallel processing
- Compress large payloads (gzip/zstd); chunk multi‑GB files
- Use incremental exports keyed by `updated_at`
- Stage to durable storage (S3/GCS) with lifecycle policies

### Validation and Observability

- Emit export metrics: records, duration, error rate, bytes
- Write manifest files with counts and checksums
- Correlate export IDs across systems for traceability

---

## Supplemental: Dashboard Creation (Design System)

<InfoBox title="Design principles">
  Start with questions stakeholders ask weekly. Place answers as KPI cards, then add trends and drill‑downs. Keep visual grammar consistent across dashboards.
</InfoBox>

### Step‑by‑Step Creation

1) Define audience and top 3 questions to answer
2) Select 3–5 KPIs with unambiguous definitions
3) Add trend charts and variance indicators per KPI
4) Provide drill‑downs to operational tables
5) Add annotations and ownership metadata
6) Test on laptop and mobile; verify accessibility

### Widget Catalog

- KPI Card: value, delta, target; supports thresholds
- Time‑Series: line/area with rolling averages
- Categorical: stacked bars/treemaps for composition
- Tables: sortable with conditional formatting and export
- Alerts: surfaced exceptions with runbook links

### Governance

- Dashboard owner, last‑reviewed date, change log
- Versioned templates; reuse across BUs
- Feedback mechanism for users to request changes

---

## Supplemental: Automation Setup (End‑to‑End)

<InfoBox title="Reliability first">
  Automations must fail safe, notify owners, and provide retry paths. Treat schedules as production code.
</InfoBox>

### Scheduling and Orchestration

- Chain pre‑checks → export → validation → distribution
- Define blackout windows and maintenance exclusions
- Use retries with jitter; cap attempts and escalate

### Conditional Reporting

- Send “all clear” weekly; send detailed report only on threshold breach
- Branch by audience: exec summary vs. operator detail
- Attach CSV for operators; PDF for leadership

### Alert Triggers

- Threshold: compliance &lt; 95% or failures &gt; 50
- Anomaly: variance &gt; 2σ vs. baseline
- Freshness: data older than SLA

### Failure Handling

- On failure: snapshot logs, keep artifacts, open ticket
- Auto‑rollback to previous stable template when applicable
- Pager/Chat notifications with runbook link

---

## Supplemental: Analytics Integration (PostHog and External)

<InfoBox title="Analytics goals">
  Track how stakeholders use dashboards and reports to improve design and prioritization.
</InfoBox>

### PostHog Setup

```console
Analytics > PostHog > Configure
1. Add project key and server endpoint
2. Define events: report_viewed, export_downloaded, drilldown_clicked
3. Attach dashboard/report IDs as properties
4. Enable session recording for opt‑in pilot group
5. Build funnels: "Home → Dashboard → Drilldown → Export"
```

### External Tools

- BI: Power BI/Tableau for executive consumption
- Data Warehouse: BigQuery/Snowflake for cross‑domain analytics
- Notebooks: Jupyter for ad‑hoc analysis; share via portal

### Privacy and Compliance

- Respect user privacy; mask PII in analytics
- Provide opt‑out controls; retain per policy

## Section F: Enterprise Report Architecture (45 minutes)

### Distributed Reporting Infrastructure

**Multi-Site Reporting Architecture**
- **Regional Report Servers**: Localized processing for performance
- **Global Aggregation**: Centralized data consolidation
- **Load Balancing**: Distributed report generation across servers
- **Failover Configuration**: High availability for critical reports

**Architecture Components**:
```console
Infrastructure > Distributed > Configuration
1. Deploy regional report servers in major data centers
2. Configure data replication and synchronization
3. Implement global load balancer with health checks
4. Set up cross-region failover and recovery
5. Monitor inter-region latency and performance
```

<InfoBox type="architecture">
**Scale Strategy**: Deploy report servers close to data sources to minimize latency. Use regional aggregation before global consolidation for optimal performance.
</InfoBox>

### Report Caching and Performance Optimization

**Multi-Layer Caching Strategy**:
```yaml
cache_configuration:
  l1_cache:
    type: memory
    size: 2GB
    ttl: 300s
    scope: per_server

  l2_cache:
    type: redis
    size: 20GB
    ttl: 3600s
    scope: shared_cluster

  l3_cache:
    type: object_storage
    size: unlimited
    ttl: 86400s
    scope: global

  invalidation_rules:
    - trigger: data_update
      action: invalidate_affected
    - trigger: schema_change
      action: full_invalidation
    - trigger: scheduled
      action: refresh_popular
```

**Cache Optimization Techniques**:
- **Query Result Caching**: Store frequently accessed query results
- **Report Fragment Caching**: Cache reusable report components
- **Pre-computation**: Generate common aggregations in advance
- **Smart Invalidation**: Selective cache clearing based on data changes

### Advanced Data Pipeline Architecture

    def __init__(self, config):
        self.extractors = self.init_extractors(config.sources)
        self.transformers = self.init_transformers(config.rules)
        self.loaders = self.init_loaders(config.destinations)
        self.orchestrator = PipelineOrchestrator(config.workflow)

    def execute(self):
        # Extract phase with parallel processing
        raw_data = self.parallel_extract()

        # Transform with validation and enrichment
        transformed = self.transform_with_quality_checks(raw_data)

        # Load with error handling and rollback
        results = self.load_with_recovery(transformed)

        # Generate execution report
        return self.generate_pipeline_report(results)

    def parallel_extract(self):
        with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as executor:
            futures = []
            for extractor in self.extractors:
                future = executor.submit(extractor.extract)
                futures.append(future)

            results = []
            for future in as_completed(futures):
                try:
                    data = future.result(timeout=300)
                    results.append(data)
                except TimeoutError:
                    self.handle_extraction_timeout()

            return self.merge_extracted_data(results)
```

**Pipeline Monitoring and Observability**:
- **Metrics Collection**: Track throughput, latency, error rates
- **Data Lineage**: Trace data flow from source to destination
- **Quality Monitoring**: Automated data quality checks at each stage
- **Alert Configuration**: Proactive notification of pipeline issues

        this.encryptor = new FieldEncryptor(config.encryption);
        this.auditor = new PrivacyAuditor(config.logging);
    }

    processReportData(data) {
        // Detect PII in data
        const piiFields = this.piiDetector.scan(data);

        // Apply masking based on user role and context
        const maskedData = this.applyContextualMasking(data, piiFields);

        // Encrypt sensitive fields
        const encryptedData = this.encryptSensitiveFields(maskedData);

        this.auditor.logDataAccess({
            timestamp: new Date(),
            data: this.getDataFingerprint(data),
            user: this.getCurrentUser(),
            purpose: this.getAccessPurpose()
        });

        return encryptedData;
    }

    applyContextualMasking(data, piiFields) {
        const userRole = this.getUserRole();
        const accessContext = this.getAccessContext();

        return this.masker.mask(data, piiFields, {
            role: userRole,
            context: accessContext,
            regulations: this.getApplicableRegulations()
        });

2. Configure audit logging for all PHI access
3. Enable encryption for data at rest and in transit
4. Set up automatic logoff and session management
5. Generate security risk assessments
```

### Advanced Access Control and Governance

**Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**:
```python
class ABACEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.policy_store = PolicyStore()
        self.attribute_resolver = AttributeResolver()
        self.decision_engine = DecisionEngine()

    def authorize_report_access(self, user, report, context):
        # Resolve user attributes
        user_attributes = self.attribute_resolver.get_user_attributes(user)

        # Resolve report attributes
        report_attributes = self.attribute_resolver.get_report_attributes(report)

        # Resolve environmental attributes
        env_attributes = self.attribute_resolver.get_environment_attributes(context)

        # Combine all attributes
        request_context = {
            'user': user_attributes,
            'resource': report_attributes,
            'environment': env_attributes,
            'action': 'view_report'
        }

        # Evaluate policies
        decision = self.decision_engine.evaluate(
            self.policy_store.get_applicable_policies(request_context),
            request_context
        )

        # Log decision

## Section I: Advanced Troubleshooting Scenarios (30 minutes)

### Complex Performance Troubleshooting

**Scenario: Report Generation Timeout in Production**

**Symptoms**:
- Reports timing out after 5 minutes
- Database CPU at 95%+
- Users experiencing browser crashes
- Export queue backing up

**Diagnostic Approach**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Advanced Performance Diagnostics

echo "=== Database Query Analysis ==="
psql -c "
SELECT
    query,
    calls,
    mean_time,
    total_time,
    stddev_time
FROM pg_stat_statements
WHERE mean_time > 5000
ORDER BY total_time DESC

    pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(indexrelid)) as index_size
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
WHERE idx_scan = 0
AND indexrelid NOT IN (
    SELECT indexrelid
    FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
    WHERE idx_scan > 0
)
ORDER BY pg_relation_size(indexrelid) DESC;
"

echo "=== Report Server Memory Analysis ==="
ps aux | grep report_server | awk '{sum+=$6} END {print "Total RSS: " sum/1024 " MB"}'

echo "=== Network Latency Check ==="
for server in db1 db2 cache1 cache2; do
    echo -n "$server: "
    ping -c 5 -q $server | tail -1 | awk '{print $4}'
done
```

**Root Cause Analysis Process**:
1. **Query Optimization**: Identify and optimize slow queries
2. **Index Analysis**: Add missing indexes, remove unused ones
3. **Resource Allocation**: Adjust memory and CPU allocation
4. **Caching Strategy**: Implement aggressive caching for static data
5. **Partitioning**: Implement table partitioning for large datasets

**Resolution Implementation**:
```sql
-- Performance optimization queries
-- Add missing indexes
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_report_data_composite
ON report_data(report_date, status, organization_id)
WHERE deleted = false;

-- Partition large tables
CREATE TABLE report_data_2024_q4 PARTITION OF report_data
FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-10-01') TO ('2025-01-01');

-- Update statistics
ANALYZE report_data;
VACUUM ANALYZE report_data;

-- Optimize query planner
SET random_page_cost = 1.1;
SET effective_cache_size = '24GB';
```
