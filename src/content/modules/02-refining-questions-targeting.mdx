# Learn

## Key Concepts

- RBAC principles and content sets
- Group types: dynamic vs static; performance implications
- Advanced filters: AND/OR/NOT; nested conditions

<InfoBox title="Exam Relevance">
  This domain carries the highest weight on the blueprint (≈23%). Mastery of
  targeting logic and safety practices is essential to pass the real exam.
</InfoBox>

## Advanced Filtering Deep‑Dive

- Boolean logic ordering and short‑circuit behavior (AND before OR; use parentheses generously)
- Common patterns:
  - OS "Windows" AND (Patch Status = "Missing" OR Last Scan > 14 days)
  - Regex filters for version ranges (e.g., `^10\.(2[2-9]|[3-9][0-9])`)
  - NOT filters to exclude test/staging cohorts
- Performance tactics:
  - Prefer indexed sensor data when available; avoid overly broad string contains on huge datasets
  - Constrain with pre‑filters first (e.g., platform or ownership) then add specifics
  - Validate result set with sampled cohorts before scaling

### Dynamic vs Static Groups (When and Why)

- Dynamic: rules‑based, auto‑updated membership; ideal for posture and fleet segmentation
- Static: manually curated; ideal for change windows, high‑risk actions, or incident cohorts
- Hybrid: seed a static cohort, then gate with a dynamic condition for increased safety

### RBAC & Content Sets

- Separate duties: who can create groups vs who can target actions
- Content sets per domain of control (e.g., Patch, Asset, Deploy) with limited scope
- Checklist for least‑privilege:
  1. Content set alignment verified for group owners
  2. Reviewer role assigned for change approval
  3. Audit trail enabled for group edits and action usage

## Safety Guardrails (Real‑World)

1. Start narrow → expand gradually; never blast unbounded groups
2. Use labels or tags on groups to indicate risk level and owner
3. Add a "dry‑run" question to verify the membership before deploying actions
4. Establish rollback cohorts (static) for all high‑risk activities
5. Document assumptions and data sources per group rule

## Console Steps

1. Navigate to Computer Groups → Create Dynamic Group
2. Define conditions (e.g., OS contains "Windows" AND Patch Status = "Missing")
3. Save to appropriate content set and assign roles
4. In Interact, select the group under Targeting
5. Validate scope on a small cohort before full rollout

> Tip: Document group criteria and owners; review performance on large estates.

## Troubleshooting Playbook

- Over‑scoped group? Add exclusion rules with explicit NOT filters and confirm with sample devices
- Under‑scoped? Verify sensor freshness and rule logic; check operator precedence
- Slow queries? Reduce wildcards and `contains` scans; limit to platform or subnet first
- Inconsistent membership? Confirm sensor availability across OS variants; verify permissions

- Drills on complex filters and nested conditions; map items to `REFINING_QUESTIONS` and `RBAC`, `Groups` tags.
- Include troubleshooting items for over/under-scoped groups.

### Knowledge Checks (sample)

1. Given `OS = Windows AND (Patch Missing OR AV Disabled)`, which change yields the largest
   reduction in scope? Why?
2. You must target only servers in `us-east` with an approved change window. Propose a hybrid
   static+dynamic strategy and validation steps.
3. A group unexpectedly includes macOS devices. Identify the likely rule flaw and fix it.

# Labs

1) RT‑101 Dynamic Groups: Windows servers missing critical patch
   - Build dynamic rule; verify with dry‑run question
   - Add owner metadata; publish in correct content set

2) RT‑201 Advanced Filtering: Regex and nested logic
   - Create filtered cohort by version pattern and last‑seen recency
   - Validate sample devices and performance

3) RT‑301 Scope Validation and Rollback
   - Establish static rollback cohort
   - Run safe no‑op action across dynamic group; confirm telemetry
