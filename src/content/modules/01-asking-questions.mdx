# Asking Questions: Foundation of Tanium Operations

## ðŸŽ¯ Domain Overview

**Domain Weight**: 22% of TAN-1000 exam | **Difficulty**: Beginner to Intermediate

The "Asking Questions" domain forms the foundation of all Tanium operations. Every administrative task, security investigation, and system management action begins with asking the right question in the right way.

## ðŸ§  Core Concepts

### Natural Language Query Construction

Tanium's revolutionary approach uses **natural language processing** to convert human-readable questions into powerful system queries.

<InfoBox title="Key Insight">
  The Tanium question format follows: **Get [sensor] from [targets] where [filters]**
</InfoBox>

**Example Query Patterns**:

- `Get Computer Name from all machines`
- `Get Running Services from all machines where IP Address contains "192.168"`
- `Get Installed Applications from all machines where Computer Name contains "SERVER"`

### The 500+ Sensor Library

**Built-in Sensors** provide immediate access to system information:

- **System Sensors**: Computer Name, IP Address, Operating System, Uptime
- **Security Sensors**: Running Processes, Open Ports, User Rights, Services
- **Application Sensors**: Installed Applications, Running Applications, Browser Extensions
- **Hardware Sensors**: CPU Usage, Memory Usage, Disk Space, Network Interface

<InfoBox title="Pro Tip">
  Use the **Sensor Library** to explore available sensors and understand their parameters before
  constructing queries.
</InfoBox>

### Custom Sensor Creation

When built-in sensors don't meet your needs, create **custom sensors**:

```bash
# Example: Custom Registry Sensor
Sensor Name: Custom Registry Check
Platform: Windows
Script: reg query "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\MyApp" /v Version 2>nul
```

## ðŸ“Š Saved Question Management

### Creation and Deployment

1. **Create**: Construct and test your query
2. **Validate**: Ensure query returns expected results
3. **Save**: Store with descriptive metadata
4. **Share**: Deploy to appropriate user groups
5. **Monitor**: Track usage and performance

### Best Practices

- **Descriptive Names**: Use clear, searchable naming conventions
- **Documentation**: Add context and usage instructions
- **Performance**: Monitor execution time and resource usage
- **Lifecycle**: Regular review and cleanup of unused questions
