# Asking Questions: Foundation of Tanium Operations

## 🎯 Domain Overview

**Domain Weight**: 22% of TAN-1000 exam | **Difficulty**: Beginner to Intermediate

The "Asking Questions" domain forms the foundation of all Tanium operations. Every administrative task, security investigation, and system management action begins with asking the right question in the right way.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### Natural Language Query Construction

Tanium's revolutionary approach uses **natural language processing** to convert human-readable questions into powerful system queries.

<InfoBox title="Key Insight">
  The Tanium question format follows: **Get [sensor] from [targets] where [filters]**
</InfoBox>

**Example Query Patterns**:

- `Get Computer Name from all machines`
- `Get Running Services from all machines where IP Address contains "192.168"`
- `Get Installed Applications from all machines where Computer Name contains "SERVER"`

<QueryPlayground
  title="Practice: Basic Query"
  instruction="Try getting the computer names from all machines. This is the most fundamental Tanium query."
  expectedQuery="Get Computer Name from all machines"
  expectedResult="DESKTOP-ABC123
LAPTOP-XYZ789
SERVER-PROD01
WORKSTATION-DEV42
... (showing 100 of 5,432 results)"
  hint="Start with 'Get Computer Name' and end with 'from all machines'"
  difficulty="beginner"
/>

<QueryPlayground
  title="Practice: Query with Filter"
  instruction="Get the Operating System from machines that have 'SERVER' in their name."
  expectedQuery="Get Operating System from all machines where Computer Name contains SERVER"
  expectedResult="Windows Server 2019 Standard
Windows Server 2022 Datacenter
Windows Server 2016 Standard
... (showing 50 of 287 results)"
  hint="Use 'where Computer Name contains' to filter"
  difficulty="beginner"
/>

### The 500+ Sensor Library

**Built-in Sensors** provide immediate access to system information:

- **System Sensors**: Computer Name, IP Address, Operating System, Uptime
- **Security Sensors**: Running Processes, Open Ports, User Rights, Services
- **Application Sensors**: Installed Applications, Running Applications, Browser Extensions
- **Hardware Sensors**: CPU Usage, Memory Usage, Disk Space, Network Interface

<InfoBox title="Pro Tip">
  Use the **Sensor Library** to explore available sensors and understand their parameters before
  constructing queries.
</InfoBox>

<MicroQuizMDX
  question="What is the primary purpose of Tanium sensors?"
  options={[
    "To monitor network traffic patterns",
    "To collect real-time endpoint data and system information",
    "To deploy software updates to endpoints",
    "To scan for network vulnerabilities"
  ]}
  correctAnswer="To collect real-time endpoint data and system information"
  explanation="Sensors in Tanium are the core mechanism for querying and collecting specific pieces of information from endpoints in real-time. They can gather system data, security information, hardware details, and application status across thousands of endpoints simultaneously."
  concept="Sensors"
/>

### Custom Sensor Creation

When built-in sensors don't meet your needs, create **custom sensors**:

```bash
# Example: Custom Registry Sensor
Sensor Name: Custom Registry Check
Platform: Windows
Script: reg query "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\MyApp" /v Version 2>nul
```

<QueryPlayground
  title="Practice: Hardware Query"
  instruction="Query for disk space information from all machines."
  expectedQuery="Get Disk Space from all machines"
  expectedResult="C:\ - 45GB Free of 250GB Total (18%)
C:\ - 120GB Free of 500GB Total (24%)
C:\ - 8GB Free of 120GB Total (7%)
D:\ - 900GB Free of 1TB Total (90%)
... (showing disk info for all machines)"
  hint="Use the 'Disk Space' sensor"
  difficulty="beginner"
/>

## 📊 Saved Question Management

### Creation and Deployment

1. **Create**: Construct and test your query
2. **Validate**: Ensure query returns expected results
3. **Save**: Store with descriptive metadata
4. **Share**: Deploy to appropriate user groups
5. **Monitor**: Track usage and performance

### Best Practices

- **Descriptive Names**: Use clear, searchable naming conventions
- **Documentation**: Add context and usage instructions
- **Performance**: Monitor execution time and resource usage
- **Lifecycle**: Regular review and cleanup of unused questions

<MicroQuizMDX
  question="What is the correct lifecycle order for managing a saved question in Tanium?"
  options={[
    "Save → Create → Validate → Share → Monitor",
    "Create → Save → Validate → Monitor → Share",
    "Create → Validate → Save → Share → Monitor",
    "Validate → Create → Save → Share → Monitor"
  ]}
  correctAnswer="Create → Validate → Save → Share → Monitor"
  explanation="The correct lifecycle follows a logical progression: First, CREATE your query by constructing it. Then VALIDATE that it returns expected results. Next, SAVE it with descriptive metadata. Then SHARE it with appropriate user groups. Finally, continuously MONITOR its usage and performance to ensure it remains effective and efficient."

## 🔧 Advanced Query Optimization Techniques

### Index Utilization Strategy

**Indexed Sensors** (Fast):
- Computer Name
- Computer ID
- Operating System
- IP Address
- Last Reboot Time

**Non-Indexed Sensors** (Slower):
- Running Processes
- Installed Applications
- Registry Values
- File Properties

**Optimization Pattern**:
```tanium
// Inefficient - scans all machines
Get Computer Name from all machines
where Installed Applications containing "Chrome"
and Operating System containing "Windows 10"

// Optimized - filters on indexed field first
Get Computer Name from all machines
where Operating System containing "Windows 10"
and Installed Applications containing "Chrome"
```

**Performance Improvement**: 60-70% faster

### Query Result Caching

**Cache Configuration**:
```tanium
Get CPU Usage from all machines (sensor cache max age:300)
```

**Cache Strategy Matrix**:

| Sensor Type | Recommended Cache | Rationale |
|------------|-------------------|-----------||
| Static (OS, Model) | 86400 (24hr) | Rarely changes |
| Semi-Static (Software) | 3600 (1hr) | Occasional updates |
| Dynamic (CPU, Memory) | 300 (5min) | Frequent changes |
| Critical (Security) | 0 (none) | Always fresh |

### Compound Sensor Optimization

**Single Sensor Call**:
```tanium
Get {Computer Identity[Computer Name,Domain,IP Address,MAC Address]}
from all machines
```

**Benefits**:
- Single endpoint execution
- Reduced network traffic
- Consistent data snapshot
- 75% faster than separate queries

```
# Optimal order: Platform → Domain → Subnet → String filters
Get Computer Name, Target_Sensor
from all machines
where OS Platform = "Windows"          # Fast: Indexed constraint
AND Domain contains "CORP"             # Medium: Domain lookup
AND IP Address contains "10.50."       # Medium: Network constraint
AND Computer Name contains "WKS-"      # Slower: String operation
AND Target_Sensor contains "criteria"  # Slowest: Sensor evaluation
```

*Pattern B: Efficient Field Projection*
```
# Return minimal fields initially
Get Computer Name, Critical_Field_Only
from all machines where [constraints]

# Then pivot for additional details on subset
Get Computer Name, Detailed_Field_1, Detailed_Field_2, Detailed_Field_3
from machines with names in ("HOST001", "HOST002", "HOST003")
```

*Pattern C: Time-Based Optimization*
```
# Use temporal constraints to reduce dataset
Get Computer Name, Event_Data
from all machines
where Last Seen within last 24 hours     # Exclude stale systems
AND Event_Data newer than 1 week         # Recent events only
AND [other constraints]
```

)
AND NOT Computer Name contains "-DEV-"
```

**25. Error Handling and Troubleshooting Patterns**

*Progressive Query Validation:*
```
# Step 1: Test sensor availability
Get Computer Name, Test_Sensor from 10 machines where OS Platform = "Windows"

# Step 2: Validate filter logic
Get Computer Name from 10 machines where [filter_conditions]

# Step 3: Test full query on small subset
Get [all_fields] from 25 machines where [all_conditions]

# Step 4: Full deployment with monitoring
Get [all_fields] from all machines where [all_conditions]
```

*Fallback Query Patterns:*
```
# Primary query with fallback for missing sensors
Try: Get Computer Name, Primary_Sensor from all machines where [conditions]
Fallback: Get Computer Name, Alternative_Sensor from all machines where [conditions]
Emergency: Get Computer Name, Basic_Info from all machines where OS Platform = "Windows"
```

## Custom Sensor Creation Guide

<InfoBox title="When to build a custom sensor?">
  When built-in sensors cannot express a required check, when data must be normalized from
  a unique file/registry path, or when you need environment-specific logic.
</InfoBox>

### PowerShell Sensors (5 examples)

```powershell
# 1) Check Windows Feature
Get-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Containers | Select-Object State

systemctl is-active taniumclient || echo inactive

# 2) Open port check
ss -lnt | awk '{print $4}' | grep -E ':22$' | wc -l

# 3) Package version
dpkg -s openssl 2>/dev/null | grep -i '^version' | cut -d ' ' -f2

# 4) Kernel version
uname -r

# 5) Disk free percent
df -h / | tail -1 | awk '{print $5}'
```

#### Additional Bash Sensors (5 more)

who -b | awk '{print $3, $4}'

# 10) Check if disk encryption (LUKS) devices exist
lsblk -o NAME,TYPE | grep -qi crypt && echo encrypted || echo not_encrypted
```

### Python Sensors (3 examples)

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# 1) JSON config read
import json, sys
try:
    with open('/etc/app/config.json') as f:
        data = json.load(f)
    print(data.get('enabled', False))
except Exception:
    print('unknown')

# 2) Simple HTTP reachability (internal health)
import urllib.request
try:
    urllib.request.urlopen('http://127.0.0.1:8080/health', timeout=2)
    print('ok')
except Exception:
    print('down')

# 3) Log tail pattern match
import re
count = 0
for line in open('/var/log/app/app.log', errors='ignore'):
    if re.search(r'ERROR', line):
        count += 1
print(count)
```

#### Additional PowerShell Sensors (5 more)

```powershell
# 6) Pending reboot state
if (Test-Path 'HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\WindowsUpdate\\Auto Update\\RebootRequired') { 'Pending' } else { 'NotPending' }

# 7) Top CPU process name
Get-Process | Sort-Object CPU -Descending | Select-Object -First 1 -ExpandProperty ProcessName

# 8) Disk free percent (system drive)
$sys = Get-CimInstance Win32_LogicalDisk -Filter "DeviceID='C:'"; [math]::Round(($sys.FreeSpace/$sys.Size)*100,0)

```

### Best Practices and Testing

- Keep output deterministic and concise (avoid verbose logs)
- Prefer platform-native tools (PowerShell on Windows, Bash on Linux/macOS)
- Handle errors gracefully and return a known fallback value
- Benchmark sensors on small cohorts; avoid heavy filesystem scans
- Version your custom sensors and document purpose, owner, and expected output schema

## Advanced Custom Sensor Development

<InfoBox title="Enterprise Sensor Development Strategy">
  Custom sensors should be modular, well-documented, and tested across diverse environments.
  Follow enterprise development practices including version control, peer review, and staged deployment.
</InfoBox>

### Step-by-Step Custom Sensor Creation Process

#### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis and Design

**1. Define Sensor Objectives**
```yaml
Sensor Name: Windows Defender Real-Time Protection Status
Purpose: Validate Windows Defender real-time protection is enabled
Platform: Windows 10/11, Windows Server 2016+
Expected Output: "Enabled" | "Disabled" | "Not Available" | "Error"
Performance Target: &lt; 2 seconds per endpoint
Error Handling: Graceful fallback to registry check if WMI fails
```

**2. Research Data Sources**
- **Primary**: WMI (Win32_OperatingSystem, MSFT_MpPreference)
- **Secondary**: Registry (HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Defender)
- **Tertiary**: PowerShell Get-MpPreference cmdlet
- **Fallback**: Service status check

**3. Design Sensor Logic Flow**
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B{WMI Available?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Query MSFT_MpPreference]
    B -->|No| D[Check Registry]
    C --> E{Real-time Protection?}
    E -->|True| F[Return "Enabled"]
    E -->|False| G[Return "Disabled"]
    E -->|Error| D
    D --> H{Registry Value Found?}
    H -->|Yes| I[Parse Registry Value]
    H -->|No| J[Check Service Status]
    I --> K{Value = 1?}
    K -->|Yes| F
    K -->|No| G
    J --> L{Service Running?}
    L -->|Yes| M[Return "Service Running"]
    L -->|No| N[Return "Not Available"]
```

**8. Advanced Sensor Patterns and Techniques**

**Pattern 1: Multi-Platform Sensor with Auto-Detection**

```powershell
# Universal Security Status Sensor
# Automatically detects platform and uses appropriate method

# Platform detection
$IsWindows = $PSVersionTable.PSVersion.Major -ge 6 ? $IsWindows : $true
$IsLinux = $PSVersionTable.PSVersion.Major -ge 6 ? $IsLinux : $false
$IsMacOS = $PSVersionTable.PSVersion.Major -ge 6 ? $IsMacOS : $false

if ($IsWindows) {
    # Windows Defender logic
    try {
        $DefenderStatus = Get-MpPreference -ErrorAction Stop
        if ($DefenderStatus.DisableRealtimeMonitoring -eq $false) {
            Write-Output "Windows Defender: Enabled"
        } else {
            Write-Output "Windows Defender: Disabled"
        }
    } catch {
        Write-Output "Windows Defender: Unknown"
    }
} elseif ($IsLinux) {
    # Linux security tools check
    $SecurityTools = @()

    # Check ClamAV
    if (Get-Command clamav -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue) {
        $SecurityTools += "ClamAV"
    }

    # Check AppArmor
    if (Test-Path "/sys/module/apparmor") {
        $SecurityTools += "AppArmor"
    }

    # Check SELinux
    if (Get-Command getenforce -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue) {
        $SecurityTools += "SELinux"
    }

    Write-Output "Linux Security: $($SecurityTools -join ', ')"
} elseif ($IsMacOS) {
    # macOS security check
    try {
        $XProtectStatus = system_profiler SPInstallHistoryDataType | Select-String -Pattern "XProtect"
        if ($XProtectStatus) {
            Write-Output "macOS XProtect: Active"
        } else {
            Write-Output "macOS XProtect: Unknown"
        }
    } catch {
        Write-Output "macOS Security: Unknown"
    }
} else {
    Write-Output "Unknown Platform"
}
```

**Pattern 2: Sensor with Caching and Rate Limiting**

```powershell
# Cached Security Assessment Sensor
# Implements local caching to reduce system impact

param(
    [int]$CacheExpiryMinutes = 15,
    [string]$CacheDirectory = "$env:TEMP\TaniumSensorCache"
)

$SensorName = "SecurityAssessment"
$CacheFile = Join-Path $CacheDirectory "$SensorName.cache"

# Ensure cache directory exists
if (!(Test-Path $CacheDirectory)) {
    New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $CacheDirectory -Force | Out-Null
}

# Check cache validity
$UseCache = $false
if (Test-Path $CacheFile) {
    $CacheTime = (Get-Item $CacheFile).LastWriteTime
    $ExpiryTime = (Get-Date).AddMinutes(-$CacheExpiryMinutes)

    if ($CacheTime -gt $ExpiryTime) {
        $UseCache = $true
    }
}

if ($UseCache) {
    # Return cached result
    Get-Content $CacheFile -Raw
} else {
    # Perform fresh assessment
    $Assessment = @{
        Timestamp = Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"
        Antivirus = (Get-MpPreference).DisableRealtimeMonitoring -eq $false ? "Enabled" : "Disabled"
        Firewall = (Get-NetFirewallProfile -Profile Domain,Public,Private | Where-Object {$_.Enabled -eq $false}).Count -eq 0 ? "Enabled" : "Partial"
        Updates = (Get-HotFix | Sort-Object InstalledOn -Descending | Select-Object -First 1).InstalledOn
    }

    $Result = $Assessment | ConvertTo-Json -Compress

    # Cache the result
    $Result | Out-File $CacheFile -Encoding UTF8

    # Return result
    $Result
}
```

**Pattern 3: Sensor with Built-in Monitoring and Alerting**

```powershell
# Self-Monitoring Sensor with Health Checks
# Includes performance metrics and automatic alerting

$SensorConfig = @{
    Name = "CriticalServiceMonitor"
    Version = "1.3.0"
    MaxExecutionTime = 10

}

$LogFile = Join-Path $SensorConfig.LogPath "$($SensorConfig.Name).log"

function Write-SensorLog {
    param($Message, $Level = "INFO")
    $Timestamp = Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"
    "$Timestamp [$Level] $Message" | Add-Content $LogFile
}

# Start performance monitoring
$StartTime = Get-Date
Write-SensorLog "Sensor execution started"

try {

    $ServiceStatus = @{}

    foreach ($Service in $CriticalServices) {
        $ServiceObj = Get-Service -Name $Service -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
        if ($ServiceObj) {
            $ServiceStatus[$Service] = $ServiceObj.Status.ToString()
        } else {
            $ServiceStatus[$Service] = "Not Found"
        }
    }

    # Generate output
    $Output = @{
        Timestamp = Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"

    Write-SensorLog "Service check completed successfully"

} catch {

        Timestamp = Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"
        Error = $_.Exception.Message
        HealthCheck = "Fail"
    }

    Write-SensorLog "Sensor execution failed: $($_.Exception.Message)" -Level "ERROR"
}

# Performance monitoring
$ExecutionTime = ((Get-Date) - $StartTime).TotalSeconds
$Output.ExecutionTime = [math]::Round($ExecutionTime, 2)

Write-SensorLog "Execution completed in $($Output.ExecutionTime) seconds"

# Alert if execution time exceeds threshold
if ($ExecutionTime -gt $SensorConfig.MaxExecutionTime) {
    Write-SensorLog "ALERT: Execution time ($ExecutionTime s) exceeded threshold ($($SensorConfig.MaxExecutionTime) s)" -Level "WARN"
}

# Output result
$Output | ConvertTo-Json -Compress
```

  and standardized error handling patterns.
</InfoBox>

#### Common Sensor Issues and Solutions

**Issue 1: Inconsistent Output Across Systems**

*Symptoms:*
- Same sensor returns different results on similar systems
- Output format varies between endpoints
- Sporadic "null" or empty results

*Debugging Steps:*
```powershell
# Enhanced sensor with debugging output
param([switch]$Debug)

if ($Debug) {
    $VerbosePreference = "Continue"
    $DebugPreference = "Continue"
}

Write-Verbose "Starting sensor execution on $env:COMPUTERNAME"
Write-Verbose "PowerShell version: $($PSVersionTable.PSVersion)"
Write-Verbose "OS Version: $([Environment]::OSVersion)"

# Your sensor logic here with verbose logging
try {
    Write-Verbose "Attempting primary method..."
    $Result = Get-SomeData -ErrorAction Stop
    Write-Verbose "Primary method successful: $Result"
} catch {
    Write-Verbose "Primary method failed: $($_.Exception.Message)"
    Write-Verbose "Attempting fallback method..."
    # Fallback logic
}
```

*Solution Patterns:*
- Implement comprehensive error handling with fallback methods
- Use consistent output formatting (JSON or structured text)
- Add platform and version detection
- Test across diverse OS versions and configurations

**Issue 2: Performance Degradation Over Time**

*Symptoms:*
- Sensor execution time increases over weeks/months
- Memory usage grows during execution
- System becomes unresponsive during sensor execution

*Performance Optimization Techniques:*
```powershell
# Memory-efficient sensor pattern
[System.GC]::Collect() # Force garbage collection at start

# Use streaming operations for large datasets
$LargeDataset | ForEach-Object {
    # Process individual items instead of loading everything into memory
    Process-Item $_
} | Select-Object -First 100 # Limit output size

# Dispose of COM objects properly
$ComObject = New-Object -ComObject "Some.Application"
try {
    # Use COM object
} finally {
    [System.Runtime.Interopservices.Marshal]::ReleaseComObject($ComObject) | Out-Null
    $ComObject = $null
}

[System.GC]::Collect() # Force garbage collection at end
```

**Issue 3: Permission and Access Denied Errors**

*Symptoms:*
- "Access Denied" errors on some systems
- Inconsistent behavior between admin and non-admin contexts
- Registry or WMI access failures

*Permission-Aware Sensor Pattern:*
```powershell
# Check execution context
function Test-AdminPrivileges {
    $CurrentUser = [Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent()
    $Principal = New-Object Security.Principal.WindowsPrincipal($CurrentUser)
    return $Principal.IsInRole([Security.Principal.WindowsBuiltInRole]::Administrator)
}

$IsAdmin = Test-AdminPrivileges

if ($IsAdmin) {
    # Use privileged methods
    try {
        $Result = Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\..." -ErrorAction Stop
    } catch {
        Write-Verbose "Admin method failed: $($_.Exception.Message)"
        # Fallback to user-accessible method
    }
} else {
    # Use non-privileged alternatives
    $Result = Get-ItemProperty "HKCU:\SOFTWARE\..." -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
}
```

## Troubleshooting Playbook

### Common Query Errors and Fixes

- "Sensor not found"
  - Fix: Check spelling/case; verify sensor exists and you have permissions

- "No results returned"
  - Fix: Relax filters; validate sensor availability and platform constraints first

- "Query too slow"
  - Fix: Constrain the cohort (platform/domain), reduce wildcards, return fewer fields

### Performance Issues and Solutions

- Large wildcard scans across fleet
  - Solution: Narrow to a BU/site first; schedule during off-hours

- Sensor output bloated
  - Solution: Return a limited set of fields and post-process downstream

- Endpoint variability (OS differences)
  - Solution: Use platform-specific branches or separate questions per OS

### Sensor Availability Problems

- Platform mismatch
  - Solution: Verify sensor supports your OS; swap to alternate sensor if needed

- Permission or path differences
  - Solution: Use elevated contexts or normalized paths; verify with a pilot endpoint

**Step 1: Simple Computer Name Query**
```
Query: Get Computer Name from all machines
Expected Results: List of all endpoint hostnames
Validation: Should return 100% of online endpoints
```

*Troubleshooting:*
- If no results: Check "all machines" target, verify endpoint connectivity
- If partial results: Some endpoints may be offline or filtered

**Step 2: Add Operating System Information**
```
Query: Get Computer Name, Operating System from all machines
Expected Results: Hostname and OS version for each endpoint
Performance: Should complete in &lt; 30 seconds for 1000 endpoints
```

*Analysis Questions:*
- How many different OS versions are in your environment?
- What percentage are Windows 10 vs Windows 11?
- Are there any unexpected or obsolete OS versions?

**Step 3: Filter by Operating System**
```
Query: Get Computer Name, Operating System from all machines where Operating System contains "Windows 11"
Expected Results: Only Windows 11 endpoints
Validation: Result count should be subset of Step 2
```

#### Exercise 1.2: Advanced Filtering and Targeting (10 minutes)

**Step 4: Hostname Pattern Filtering**
```
Query: Get Computer Name, Operating System from all machines where Computer Name contains "WKS-"
Purpose: Target workstation endpoints using naming convention
Expected Results: Only workstations, excluding servers
```

**Step 5: Multiple Filter Conditions**
```
Query: Get Computer Name, Operating System, IP Address from all machines
where Computer Name contains "WKS-"
AND Operating System contains "Windows 11"
Expected Results: Windows 11 workstations only
Performance Note: Multiple filters improve precision but may reduce result count
```

**Step 6: Boolean Logic with Parentheses**
```
Query: Get Computer Name, Operating System from all machines
where (Computer Name contains "WKS-" OR Computer Name contains "LAP-")
AND Operating System contains "Windows"
Expected Results: All Windows workstations and laptops
```

*Advanced Challenge:*

**Step 8: Test Saved Question Execution**
1. Navigate to saved questions library
2. Find your saved question
3. Execute and verify results match your manual query
4. Note execution time and endpoint coverage

**Step 9: Share and Collaborate**
1. Share question with lab partner or colleague
2. Verify they can access and execute
3. Document any permission or access issues

#### Lab 1 Assessment and Validation

**Knowledge Check Questions:**
1. What happens if you omit the "from all machines" portion?
2. How does "contains" differ from "equals" in filter performance?
3. When should you use parentheses in complex Boolean logic?
4. What's the maximum recommended number of fields to return?

**Practical Assessment:**
- Execute this query and explain the results:
  ```
  Get Computer Name, Operating System, Last Logged In User, Uptime
  from all machines
  where Operating System contains "Windows"
  AND Last Logged In User contains "admin"
  AND Uptime &gt; 30 days
  ```

**Expected Learning Outcomes:**
- [ ] Construct basic queries using natural language syntax
- [ ] Apply single and multiple filter conditions
- [ ] Use Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) correctly
- [ ] Create and manage saved questions
- [ ] Understand query performance implications

#### Exercise 2.1: Complex Security Assessment Queries (12 minutes)

**Step 1: Multi-Condition Security Baseline**
```
Query: Get Computer Name, Antivirus Status, Firewall State, OS Build Number
from all machines
where OS Platform = "Windows"
AND (Antivirus Status contains "disabled" OR Firewall State = "Off")
AND NOT Computer Name contains "-TST-"
Purpose: Identify production Windows systems with security control gaps
Expected Results: Systems requiring immediate security attention
```

*Performance Analysis:*
- Record execution time: _____ seconds
- Record result count: _____ endpoints
- Calculate success rate: _____ % (results/total endpoints)

**Step 2: Advanced Threat Hunting Pattern**
```
Query: Get Computer Name, Running Processes, Network Connections
from all machines
where OS Platform = "Windows"
AND (Running Processes contains "powershell" AND Running Processes contains "-enc")
OR (Network Connections contains "ESTABLISHED" AND Network Connections contains ":443")
Purpose: Hunt for potential APT indicators
WARNING: Expensive query - test on small subset first
```

*Optimization Challenge:*
- Test on 10 endpoints first
- If successful and fast (&lt;2 minutes), expand to 50 endpoints
- Document any performance degradation patterns

**Step 3: Compliance Violation Detection**
```
Query: Get Computer Name, Local Administrators, PowerShell Execution Policy
from all machines
where OS Platform = "Windows"
AND (Local Administrators count &gt; 3 OR PowerShell Execution Policy = "Unrestricted")
AND Domain contains "CORP"
Purpose: Detect policy violations in corporate domain
```

#### Exercise 2.2: Query Performance Optimization Workshop (15 minutes)

**Step 4: Baseline Performance Measurement**
Take any query from Exercise 2.1 and measure:
```
Original Query Performance:
- Execution Time: _____ seconds
- Endpoints Queried: _____ total
- Results Returned: _____ endpoints
- Success Rate: _____ %
- Resource Impact: High/Medium/Low
```

**Step 5: Apply Constraint Ordering Optimization**
Rewrite your query using optimal constraint order:
```
Optimized Query Structure:
Get [minimal fields]
from all machines
where OS Platform = "Windows"           # Fast: Platform constraint first
AND Domain contains "CORP"              # Medium: Domain filter second
AND [expensive filters last]            # Slow: Complex filters last
```

**Step 6: Field Projection Optimization**
```
Original: Get Computer Name, Field1, Field2, Field3, Field4 from all machines where [filters]
Optimized: Get Computer Name, Field1 from all machines where [filters]

Performance Comparison:
- Original Time: _____ seconds
- Optimized Time: _____ seconds
- Performance Improvement: _____ % faster
```

**Step 7: Staged Query Approach**
```
Stage 1: Get Computer Name from all machines where OS Platform = "Windows" AND Domain contains "CORP"
Results: _____ endpoints identified

Stage 2: Get Computer Name, Detailed_Field1, Detailed_Field2
from machines with names in ("HOST001", "HOST002", "HOST003")
Purpose: Deep dive on subset identified in Stage 1
```

#### Exercise 2.3: Regex and Advanced String Matching (8 minutes)

**Step 8: Version Pattern Matching**
```
Query: Get Computer Name, Application Versions
from all machines
where Application Versions matches "Office.*16\.0\.1[5-9][0-9]{3}"
Purpose: Find Office versions 16.0.15000 and higher
Expected Results: Modern Office 365 installations
```

**Step 9: IP Address Pattern Matching**
```
Query: Get Computer Name, IP Address
from all machines
where IP Address matches "^(10\.20\.|192\.168\.1[0-9]{2}\.)"
Purpose: Find endpoints in development/test subnets
Challenge: Modify regex for your environment's IP ranges
```

**Step 10: Advanced Process Name Filtering**
```
Query: Get Computer Name, Running Processes
from all machines
where Running Processes matches "[a-z]{1,8}\.(exe|bat|ps1|vbs)$"
Purpose: Detect potentially suspicious short process names
Security Use: Identify possible malware with random names
```

#### Lab 2 Assessment and Troubleshooting

**Performance Benchmarking Exercise:**
Complete this optimization challenge:
```
Original Query (intentionally inefficient):
Get Computer Name, Installed Applications, Running Processes, Services, Network Connections
from all machines
where Installed Applications contains "Office"
AND Running Processes contains "excel"
AND Services contains "Print Spooler"

Your Optimized Version:
[Write your optimized query here]

Performance Metrics:
- Original Time: _____ seconds
- Optimized Time: _____ seconds
- Improvement Factor: _____ x faster
```

**Common Issues and Solutions:**
1. **"Query too slow"** - Apply constraint ordering, reduce field projection
2. **"No results returned"** - Relax filters, check platform constraints
3. **"Regex not matching"** - Test regex patterns on small dataset first
4. **"Timeout errors"** - Implement staged query approach
