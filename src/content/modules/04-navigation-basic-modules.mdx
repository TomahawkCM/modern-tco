  workflow optimization, and troubleshooting. Expect scenario-based questions requiring
  you to choose the correct module and navigation path for specific business requirements.
</InfoBox>

## Section 1: Console Layout Deep Dive (45 minutes)

### Global Navigation Architecture

The Tanium console follows a hierarchical navigation structure designed for rapid access to all platform capabilities:

#### Primary Navigation Components

**Top Navigation Bar**
- **Global Search**: Universal search across all data types (sensors, saved questions, groups, users)
- **Notifications Center**: Real-time alerts for system events, scheduled actions, and user mentions
- **User Profile Menu**: Account settings, role information, and session management
- **Help System**: Context-sensitive documentation and support resources

**Left Side Navigation**
- **Module Icons**: Direct access to primary modules (Interact, Trends, Reporting, Connect, etc.)
- **Favorites**: User-customized shortcuts to frequently accessed items
- **Recently Used**: Dynamic list of last 10 accessed screens/objects
- **Administration**: System configuration and management tools (role-dependent visibility)

<InfoBox title="Navigation Best Practice">
  The left navigation auto-collapses to save screen space. Use Ctrl+Shift+N to toggle
  the navigation panel quickly. This keyboard shortcut works in all modules and saves
  significant time during intensive work sessions.
</InfoBox>
