## Section 7: Integration Strategies (30 minutes)

<InfoBox title="Module interconnections">
  Interact produces live datasets; Trends persists historical aggregates; Reporting packages insights
  for stakeholders; Connect moves data across system boundaries. Design flows that respect each
  module's strengths.
</InfoBox>

### Interconnection Patterns

- Interact → Trends: promote recurring questions to historical monitoring
- Trends → Reporting: convert panels to stakeholder dashboards
- Interact → Reporting: ad-hoc findings summarized for leadership
- Trends → Connect: stream curated time-series to warehouses/SIEM
- Connect → Reporting: enrich dashboards with third-party metrics

### Data Flow and Governance

- Establish data ownership and stewards for each domain
- Define PII handling and minimization in Connect exports
- Version schemas and maintain transformation documentation
- Implement quality checks at panel/report/pipeline boundaries

### Optimization Techniques

- Use saved questions as cache layers for expensive logic
- Align refresh schedules to avoid contention and load spikes
- Partition large datasets by region/BU for better parallelism
- Measure end-to-end latency and failure modes per flow

---

## Section 8: Best Practices and Pitfalls (20 minutes)

### Organizational Best Practices

1) Least privilege with clear ownership and review cadence
2) Standard naming conventions across questions, panels, and reports
3) Template libraries for repeatable workflows and visuals
4) Ring-based deployment for changes to data collection/exports
5) Documentation embedded close to the object (descriptions, links)
6) Health dashboards for platform and pipeline monitoring
7) Scheduled hygiene: archive, rotate, reindex, and validate
8) Cross-team change windows and comms playbooks
9) Post-incident reviews feeding into configuration improvements
10) Regular training on shortcuts, efficiency, and safety

### Common Pitfalls (and Fixes)

- Over-scoped permissions → tighten content sets; add reviewer roles
- Ad-hoc queries at fleet scale → scope with groups; validate on pilots
- Dashboard sprawl → enforce owner + last-reviewed metadata; archive policy
- No rollback for pipeline changes → versioned configs; staged promotion
- Alert fatigue in Trends → tune thresholds; require owner and runbooks
- Connect schema drift → contract tests; schema registry; change control
- Unlabeled risk → labels/tags on groups and reports; risk register
- Single maintainer knowledge silo → shared templates and documentation

<InfoBox title="Quick win">
  Add owners and review dates to the top 20 saved questions, panels, dashboards, and pipelines this
  week. Most navigation and reliability issues trace back to unlabeled or unowned content.
</InfoBox>

#### Event-Driven Architecture

**Real-Time Event Streaming**
1. **Event Generation**: Sensors detect state changes
2. **Event Processing**: Filter and enrich event data
3. **Event Distribution**: Route to appropriate consumers
4. **Event Storage**: Persist for audit and replay capability

**Kafka Integration Pattern**
```python
# Tanium to Kafka Producer
from kafka import KafkaProducer
import json

class TaniumKafkaProducer:
    def __init__(self, bootstrap_servers):
        self.producer = KafkaProducer(
            bootstrap_servers=bootstrap_servers,
            value_serializer=lambda v: json.dumps(v).encode('utf-8'),
            compression_type='gzip',
            batch_size=16384,
            linger_ms=100
        )

    def send_event(self, topic, event_data):
        # Add metadata
        event = {
            'timestamp': datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
            'source': 'tanium',
            'event_type': event_data.get('type'),
            'severity': self.calculate_severity(event_data),
            'data': event_data
        }

        # Send to Kafka
        future = self.producer.send(topic, event)
        return future.get(timeout=10)
```

### Advanced Connect Pipeline Engineering

#### Data Transformation Pipelines

**Complex ETL Operations**
```javascript
// Advanced Transform Function
function transformTaniumData(record) {
    // Data validation
    if (!validateSchema(record)) {
        throw new ValidationError('Schema validation failed');
    }

    // Field mapping
    const transformed = {
        id: generateUUID(),
        timestamp: parseTimestamp(record.timestamp),
        hostname: normalizeHostname(record.computer_name),
        ip_address: extractPrimaryIP(record.ip_addresses),

        // Complex transformations
        risk_score: calculateRiskScore({
            vulnerabilities: record.cve_count,
            patch_age: record.days_since_patch,
            exposure: record.internet_facing
        }),

        // Enrichment
        geo_location: lookupGeoIP(record.ip_address),
        business_unit: mapToBusinessUnit(record.ou_path),
        criticality: determineAssetCriticality(record)
    };

    // Data quality checks
    validateTransformedData(transformed);

    return transformed;
}
```

#### Multi-Destination Routing

**Intelligent Data Distribution**
- **Content-Based Routing**: Route based on data characteristics
- **Priority Queuing**: High-priority events bypass normal queues
- **Failure Handling**: Dead letter queues for failed transmissions
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent overwhelming destination systems

**Router Configuration Example**
```yaml
pipeline:
  name: multi_destination_router
  sources:
    - type: tanium_saved_question
      question_id: security_events
      interval: 60s

  processors:
    - type: filter
      condition: severity >= 'high'

    - type: router
      routes:
        - condition: event_type == 'malware'
          destination: siem_high_priority

        - condition: event_type == 'vulnerability'
          destination: vulnerability_management

        - condition: event_type == 'compliance'
          destination: grc_platform

        - condition: default
          destination: data_lake

  destinations:
    - name: siem_high_priority
      type: splunk
      index: security_critical

    - name: vulnerability_management
      type: qualys
      api_endpoint: /api/2.0/vulnerabilities

    - name: grc_platform
      type: servicenow
      table: compliance_findings

    - name: data_lake
      type: s3
      bucket: tanium-archive
      compression: gzip
```

### Module Performance Optimization Strategies

#### Query Optimization Techniques

**Sensor Query Optimization**
1. **Sensor Selection**: Choose lightweight sensors first
2. **Filter Early**: Apply filters at sensor level, not in post-processing
3. **Limit Scope**: Use computer groups to reduce target count
4. **Cache Results**: Leverage parameterized sensors with caching

**Database Query Tuning**
```sql
-- Optimized query with proper indexing
CREATE INDEX idx_computer_last_seen
ON computers(last_seen_time, computer_id)
WHERE deleted = false;

-- Use query hints for large datasets
SELECT /*+ PARALLEL(4) */
    c.computer_name,
    c.ip_address,
    s.sensor_value
FROM computers c
JOIN sensor_results s ON c.computer_id = s.computer_id
WHERE c.last_seen_time > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
    AND s.sensor_name = 'Running Processes'
ORDER BY c.computer_name;
```

#### Memory Management Best Practices

**Browser Memory Optimization**
- **Pagination**: Load data in chunks, not all at once
- **Virtual Scrolling**: Render only visible rows in tables
- **Lazy Loading**: Defer loading of non-critical components
- **Memory Profiling**: Regular profiling to identify leaks

**Server Memory Configuration**
```bash
# JVM tuning for Tanium Server
JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx8g -Xms8g \
    -XX:+UseG1GC \
    -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=200 \
    -XX:+ParallelRefProcEnabled \
    -XX:+AlwaysPreTouch \
    -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions \
    -XX:G1NewSizePercent=30 \
    -XX:G1MaxNewSizePercent=40"
```

2. **PHI Data Protection**: Automatic masking in console displays
3. **Audit Trail Integration**: Every query logged with purpose code
4. **Emergency Override**: Break-glass procedures for critical care

**Custom Module Configuration**:
```javascript
// HIPAA-Compliant Query Wrapper
class HIPAACompliantQuery {
    constructor(query, user, purpose) {
        this.query = query;
        this.user = user;
        this.purpose = purpose;
        this.timestamp = new Date();
        this.auditLog = new AuditLogger();
    }

    async execute() {
        // Log query attempt
        await this.auditLog.logQueryAttempt({
            user: this.user,
            query: this.sanitizeQuery(this.query),
            purpose: this.purpose,
            timestamp: this.timestamp
        });

        // Execute with PHI protection
        const results = await tanium.executeQuery(this.query);
        const maskedResults = this.maskPHI(results);

        // Log data access
        await this.auditLog.logDataAccess({
            user: this.user,
            recordCount: results.length,
            purpose: this.purpose,
            timestamp: new Date()
        });

        return maskedResults;
    }

    maskPHI(data) {
        // Mask sensitive fields
        return data.map(record => ({
            ...record,
            patient_name: '***MASKED***',
            ssn: '***-**-' + record.ssn.slice(-4),
            medical_record: '***MASKED***'
        }));
    }
}
```

### Case Study 3: Manufacturing Conglomerate

**Challenge**: OT/IT convergence with 100+ factories and critical infrastructure

**Module Integration Strategy**:
1. **Interact**: Real-time monitoring of production systems
2. **Trends**: Historical analysis of production metrics
3. **Reporting**: Executive dashboards for factory performance
4. **Connect**: Integration with MES and SCADA systems

**Production Line Monitoring**:
```python
# OT Device Monitoring Integration
class OTDeviceMonitor:
    def __init__(self, tanium_client):
        self.tanium = tanium_client
        self.critical_devices = self.load_critical_devices()
        self.alert_thresholds = self.load_thresholds()

    def monitor_production_line(self, line_id):
        # Query OT devices on production line
        query = f"""
            Get Computer Name and IP Address and
            Custom Tags[Production Line] and
            CPU Usage and Memory Usage and
            Network Throughput and
            Process Status containing "SCADA"
            from all machines where
            Custom Tags[Production Line] = "{line_id}"
        """

        results = self.tanium.run_question(query)

        # Analyze for anomalies
        anomalies = self.detect_anomalies(results)

        if anomalies:
            self.trigger_production_alert(line_id, anomalies)
            self.initiate_failover(line_id)

        return {
            'line_id': line_id,
            'status': 'critical' if anomalies else 'normal',
            'devices': len(results),
            'anomalies': anomalies
        }
```

**Results**:
- 75% reduction in production downtime
- Real-time visibility into OT environments
- Automated incident response for critical systems

### Case Study 4: Government Agency

**Challenge**: Zero Trust implementation with classified networks

**Console Security Configuration**:
1. **Air-Gapped Deployment**: Separate consoles for classified/unclassified
2. **Cross-Domain Guards**: Controlled data flow between security levels
3. **Attribute-Based Access**: Dynamic permissions based on clearance
4. **Continuous Verification**: Re-authentication for sensitive operations

**Zero Trust Navigation Model**:
```javascript
// Zero Trust Navigation Controller
class ZeroTrustNavigator {
    constructor() {
        this.sessionManager = new SecureSessionManager();
        this.policyEngine = new PolicyEngine();
        this.riskCalculator = new RiskCalculator();
    }

    async navigateToModule(user, module, context) {
        // Continuous verification
        const verificationResult = await this.verifyUser(user);
        if (!verificationResult.verified) {
            throw new SecurityException('User verification failed');
        }

        // Calculate risk score
        const riskScore = await this.riskCalculator.calculate({
            user: user,
            module: module,
            location: context.location,
            device: context.device,
            time: new Date(),
            behavior: await this.getUserBehavior(user)
        });

        // Policy decision
        const decision = await this.policyEngine.evaluate({
            user: user,
            resource: module,
            action: 'access',
            risk: riskScore,
            context: context
        });

        if (decision.allow) {
            // Grant access with conditions
            return this.grantAccess(module, decision.conditions);
        } else {
            // Deny with audit
            await this.auditDenial(user, module, decision.reason);
            throw new AccessDeniedException(decision.reason);
        }
    }
}
```

## Section 12: Advanced Troubleshooting Scenarios (35 minutes)

### Complex Performance Issues

#### Scenario 1: Intermittent Console Freezing

**Symptoms**:
- Console becomes unresponsive for 30-60 seconds
- Occurs randomly throughout the day
- Affects multiple users simultaneously

**Diagnostic Approach**:
```bash
# Performance diagnostics script
#!/bin/bash

# Check server resources
echo "=== Server Resource Check ==="
top -bn1 | head -20
iostat -x 1 5
netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED | wc -l

# Check database performance
echo "=== Database Performance ==="
psql -c "SELECT query, calls, mean_time
         FROM pg_stat_statements
         WHERE mean_time > 1000
         ORDER BY mean_time DESC
         LIMIT 10;"

# Check Tanium processes
echo "=== Tanium Process Status ==="
ps aux | grep tanium | grep -v grep
systemctl status tanium-*

# Network connectivity
echo "=== Network Latency Check ==="
for server in console1 console2 db1 db2; do
    ping -c 5 $server | tail -1
done

# Browser performance (client-side)
echo "=== Client-Side Instructions ==="
echo "1. Open browser DevTools (F12)"
echo "2. Go to Performance tab"
echo "3. Start recording before freeze"
echo "4. Export trace after freeze"
```

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. **Database Lock Contention**: Long-running queries blocking console queries
2. **Memory Pressure**: Server swapping due to insufficient RAM
3. **Network Saturation**: Bandwidth exhaustion during peak hours
4. **Browser Memory Leak**: Accumulated memory usage over time

**Resolution Steps**:
```sql
-- Fix database lock contention
-- Identify blocking queries
SELECT
    pid,
    usename,
    pg_blocking_pids(pid) as blocked_by,
    query,
    query_start
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE pg_blocking_pids(pid)::text != '{}';

-- Terminate blocking query
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid)
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE pid = <blocking_pid>;

-- Add missing indexes
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_sensor_results_timestamp
ON sensor_results(result_timestamp)
WHERE result_timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';
```

#### Scenario 2: Question Results Inconsistency

**Symptoms**:
- Same question returns different results
- Missing endpoints in results
- Data appears stale or outdated

**Systematic Troubleshooting**:
```powershell
# PowerShell diagnostic script
function Test-QuestionConsistency {
    param(
        [string]$QuestionText,
        [int]$Iterations = 5
    )

    $results = @()

    for ($i = 1; $i -le $Iterations; $i++) {
        Write-Host "Iteration $i of $Iterations"

        # Run question
        $result = Invoke-TaniumQuestion -Question $QuestionText

        # Collect metrics
        $results += @{
            Iteration = $i
            Timestamp = Get-Date
            RowCount = $result.RowCount
            EndpointCount = $result.EndpointCount
            ResponseRate = $result.ResponseRate
            Duration = $result.Duration
            Hash = Get-Hash $result.Data
        }

        Start-Sleep -Seconds 30
    }

    # Analyze consistency
    $uniqueHashes = $results.Hash | Select-Object -Unique
    if ($uniqueHashes.Count -gt 1) {
        Write-Warning "Inconsistent results detected!"
        $results | Format-Table

        # Deep analysis
        Analyze-Inconsistency -Results $results
    }
}
```

### Integration Troubleshooting

#### Connect Pipeline Failures

**Common Failure Patterns**:
1. **Authentication Expiry**: Token/certificate expiration
2. **Schema Mismatch**: Destination expects different format
3. **Rate Limiting**: Destination throttling requests
4. **Network Issues**: Firewall changes or routing problems

**Diagnostic Workflow**:
```javascript
// Pipeline Health Check
class PipelineHealthCheck {
    async diagnose(pipelineId) {
        const diagnostics = {
            timestamp: new Date(),
            pipeline: pipelineId,
            checks: []
        };

        // Test authentication
        diagnostics.checks.push(
            await this.testAuthentication(pipelineId)
        );

        // Validate schema
        diagnostics.checks.push(
            await this.validateSchema(pipelineId)
        );

        // Check network connectivity
        diagnostics.checks.push(
            await this.testConnectivity(pipelineId)
        );

        // Verify data flow
        diagnostics.checks.push(
            await this.verifyDataFlow(pipelineId)
        );

        // Generate remediation plan
        const plan = this.generateRemediationPlan(diagnostics);

        return {
            diagnostics,
            plan,
            severity: this.calculateSeverity(diagnostics)
        };
    }

    async testAuthentication(pipelineId) {
        const pipeline = await this.getPipeline(pipelineId);
        const auth = pipeline.authentication;

        try {
            if (auth.type === 'token') {
                const response = await this.validateToken(auth.token);
                return {
                    check: 'authentication',
                    status: 'pass',
                    details: `Token valid until ${response.expiry}`
                };
            } else if (auth.type === 'certificate') {
                const cert = await this.validateCertificate(auth.certificate);
                return {
                    check: 'authentication',
                    status: cert.valid ? 'pass' : 'fail',
                    details: cert.message
                };
            }
        } catch (error) {
            return {
                check: 'authentication',
                status: 'fail',
                error: error.message,
                remediation: this.getAuthRemediationSteps(auth.type)
            };
        }
    }
}
```
