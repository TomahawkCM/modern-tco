## Package Basics (25 minutes)

### What are Packages?

Packages are pre-built software components that can be deployed to endpoint computers through Tanium. They contain the files and instructions needed to install, update, or configure software on target systems.

**Key Package Components:**
- **Executable files**: The main program or script to run
- **Parameters**: Settings that control how the package behaves
- **Dependencies**: Other software that must be present
- **Installation instructions**: Steps to deploy the package

### Basic Parameter Configuration

Parameters allow you to customize how a package works without changing the package itself:

**Common Parameter Types:**
- **Text parameters**: File paths, usernames, configuration values
- **Number parameters**: Timeout values, port numbers, sizes
- **Yes/No parameters**: Enable/disable features, confirmation flags

**Example - Software Installation Package:**
```
Package: Install Chrome Browser
Parameters:
- Install Path: C:\Program Files\Chrome (text)
- Silent Install: Yes (yes/no)
- Create Desktop Shortcut: No (yes/no)
```

### Package Selection and Preparation

**Steps for Basic Package Deployment:**

1. **Choose the Right Package**
   - Verify package matches your operating system
   - Check that package version is compatible
   - Review package description and requirements

2. **Configure Parameters**
   - Fill in required parameters (marked with asterisks)
   - Use default values for optional parameters when starting
   - Double-check parameter values before deployment

3. **Select Target Systems**
   - Start with a small test group (5-10 computers)
   - Choose representative systems from different locations
   - Avoid critical production systems for initial testing

### Basic Validation and Testing

Before deploying to many systems, always test first:

**Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] Package downloads successfully to test systems
- [ ] Package installs without errors
- [ ] Software functions as expected after installation
- [ ] No conflicts with existing software
- [ ] System performance remains normal

## Action Deployment (20 minutes)

### Simple Action Deployment Procedures

Actions are how packages get deployed to endpoint computers. The basic deployment process:

1. **Open Tanium Console**
   - Navigate to Interact tab
   - Select "Deploy Action" or similar option

2. **Configure Action Settings**
   - Choose the package to deploy
   - Set parameters as configured
   - Select target computer group
   - Set action name for tracking

3. **Review and Deploy**
   - Double-check target systems and parameters
   - Click Deploy to start the action
   - Action begins running on target systems

### Target Selection and Validation

**Computer Group Selection:**
- **All Computers**: Deploys to every managed system (use carefully!)
- **Custom Groups**: Predefined groups like "Windows 10 Workstations"
- **Manual Selection**: Choose specific computers by name
- **Filter Groups**: Use questions to create dynamic targeting

**Validation Steps:**
1. Check group membership count before deploying
2. Verify group includes the right types of systems
3. Ensure no critical systems in test deployments
4. Confirm systems are online and reachable

### Deployment Monitoring Basics

**Action Status Grid:**
The Action Status grid shows real-time deployment progress:

- **Waiting**: Action queued but not started yet
- **Running**: Currently executing on the endpoint
- **Completed**: Finished successfully (exit code 0)
- **Failed**: Encountered an error during execution
- **Not Applicable**: System doesn't meet deployment criteria

**Basic Monitoring Tasks:**
- Check overall completion percentage
- Identify failed systems for troubleshooting
- Monitor network impact during large deployments
- Verify completion before proceeding to next phase

### Basic Result Interpretation

**Success Indicators:**
- High percentage of "Completed" status
- Exit code 0 from most systems
- Expected changes visible on target systems
- No significant performance impact

**Warning Signs:**
- Many systems showing "Failed" status
- High number of timeout errors
- Unexpected exit codes
- User complaints about system performance

## Exit Codes and Troubleshooting (15 minutes)

### Understanding Basic Exit Codes

Exit codes tell you what happened when a package ran. Think of them as simple status messages:

**Standard Exit Codes:**
- **0**: Success - Everything worked correctly
- **1**: General Error - Something went wrong (check logs)
- **2**: File Not Found - Package couldn't find required files
- **3**: Permission Denied - Not enough rights to install
- **126**: Cannot Execute - Package file damaged or blocked
- **127**: Command Not Found - Required software missing

**Tanium-Specific Exit Codes:**
- **1001**: Network Error - Couldn't download package
- **1002**: No Disk Space - Not enough room to install
- **1003**: Missing Requirements - Need other software first
- **1005**: Timeout - Package took too long to complete

### Common Failure Scenarios

**Scenario 1: "Permission Denied" (Exit Code 3)**
- **Cause**: User account doesn't have admin rights
- **Solution**: Run deployment with administrator account
- **Prevention**: Verify account permissions before deployment

**Scenario 2: "Network Error" (Exit Code 1001)**
- **Cause**: Endpoint can't reach Tanium server
- **Solution**: Check network connectivity and firewall rules
- **Prevention**: Test connectivity before large deployments

**Scenario 3: "Not Enough Disk Space" (Exit Code 1002)**
- **Cause**: Target system lacks storage space
- **Solution**: Free up disk space or choose smaller package
- **Prevention**: Check disk space with sensors first

### Simple Troubleshooting Steps

**Basic Troubleshooting Process:**

1. **Check Exit Codes**
   - Look at failed systems in action status
   - Note most common exit codes
   - Group similar failures together

2. **Review Error Messages**
   - Read full error text when available
   - Look for specific file names or paths
   - Note any permission or access issues

3. **Test on Single System**
   - Try deployment on one failed system
   - Watch the process more closely
   - Check system-specific issues

4. **Common Fixes**
   - Restart Tanium client service
   - Verify network connectivity
   - Check available disk space
   - Confirm user permissions

## Scheduled Actions (15 minutes)

### Creating Recurring Actions

Scheduled actions let you run deployments automatically at specific times:

**Common Scheduling Scenarios:**
- **Patch Deployments**: Monthly security updates
- **Software Updates**: Quarterly application updates
- **Maintenance Tasks**: Weekly cleanup operations
- **Monitoring**: Daily health checks

### Basic Scheduling Options

**Simple Schedule Types:**

1. **One-Time Execution**
   - Run once at specific date/time
   - Good for emergency patches
   - Can schedule for off-hours deployment

2. **Daily Recurring**
   - Repeat every day at same time
   - Often used for maintenance tasks
   - Avoid business hours for better performance

3. **Weekly Recurring**
   - Repeat same day each week
   - Common for patch deployments
   - Usually scheduled for weekends

**Example Schedule Configuration:**
```
Schedule: Weekly Patch Deployment
Frequency: Every Tuesday
Time: 3:00 AM local time
Duration: Allow up to 4 hours for completion
Retry failed systems: Yes, after 24 hours
```

### Monitoring Scheduled Tasks

**Regular Monitoring Tasks:**
- Check scheduled actions completed successfully
- Review any systems that failed deployment
- Verify scheduled time worked for organization
- Adjust timing if conflicts occur

**Basic Health Checks:**
- Weekly review of all scheduled actions
- Monthly analysis of success rates
- Quarterly review of schedule effectiveness
- Annual schedule optimization

## Basic Rollback (10 minutes)

### When to Rollback

Rollback means removing or undoing a failed deployment. Consider rollback when:

**Clear Rollback Triggers:**
- More than 20% of deployments failed
- Critical system functionality is broken
- Security issues were introduced
- Business operations are impacted

**Simple Decision Process:**
1. Stop ongoing deployment immediately
2. Assess scope of problem (how many systems affected?)
3. Determine if issue is fixable quickly
4. If not fixable in 30 minutes, plan rollback

### Simple Rollback Procedures

**Basic Rollback Steps:**

1. **Pause Current Deployment**
   - Stop action from spreading to more systems
   - Prevent additional systems from being affected

2. **Identify Affected Systems**
   - List all systems that completed the action
   - Separate successful from failed deployments
   - Focus rollback on successful installations that caused problems

3. **Deploy Rollback Package**
   - Use pre-built uninstall or restore package
   - Target only systems that need rollback
   - Monitor rollback process like original deployment

4. **Verify System Recovery**
   - Check that original functionality is restored
   - Confirm no side effects from rollback
   - Test critical business functions

### Verification Steps

**Post-Rollback Validation:**
- [ ] Target systems are functioning normally
- [ ] Business applications work as expected
- [ ] No remaining files from failed deployment
- [ ] System performance has returned to normal
- [ ] Users can perform their regular tasks

**Basic Recovery Testing:**
- Test key applications on rolled-back systems
- Verify network connectivity is working
- Check that security software is functioning
- Confirm user access to required resources

## Troubleshooting Playbook

**Quick Reference for Common Issues:**

- **High failure rate?** Check network connectivity and system requirements
- **Permission errors?** Verify service account has admin rights
- **Network timeouts?** Check firewall rules and bandwidth availability
- **Disk space errors?** Clean up temporary files or use smaller packages
- **Package not found?** Verify package availability and download paths
- **Slow deployment?** Reduce concurrent targets or schedule during off-hours
- **Rollback needed?** Stop deployment, assess impact, deploy restore package
