## Mental Model: The Question-Sensor-Data Flow

\`\`\`
Natural Language Query → Sensor Selection → Real-time Data Collection
"Get Computer Name"   →  Computer Name   →  [List of all computer names]
                         Sensor
\`\`\`

## Essential Terminology

**Questions**: Natural language queries that drive data collection
- Examples: "Get Computer Name", "Get Running Processes"  
- Written in human-readable format
- Automatically translated to sensor operations

**Sensors**: Data collection mechanisms that answer specific questions
- **Built-in Sensors**: Computer Name, IP Address, Operating System
- **Performance Sensors**: CPU Usage, Memory Usage, Disk Space  
- **Security Sensors**: Running Processes, Installed Software, Network Connections
- **Custom Sensors**: Organization-specific data collection points

**Results**: Real-time data returned from endpoints
- Displayed in tabular format
- Filterable and sortable
- Exportable for analysis

**Saved Questions**: Reusable query templates
- Standardize common operations
- Enable consistent reporting
- Facilitate knowledge sharing across teams

## Question Construction Principles

### 1. Clarity and Precision

        title: "Step-by-Step Procedures",
        content: `# Professional Procedures for Asking Questions

## Procedure 1: Basic Question Construction

### Step 1: Access the Interact Module
1. **Navigate to Console**: Log into Tanium Console with appropriate credentials
2. **Open Interact**: Main Menu → **Interact** → **Ask a Question**  
3. **Verify Interface**: Confirm question input field displays with "Get" pre-populated

**Validation Checkpoint**: Question input field is active and ready for input

### Step 2: Construct Your First Question
1. **Start Simple**: Type \`Get Computer Name\` in the question field
2. **Review Auto-Complete**: Observe sensor suggestions appearing in dropdown
3. **Select Sensor**: Click on "Computer Name" from the suggestion list
4. **Execute Query**: Click "Ask Question" button to initiate data collection
5. **Review Results**: Examine the returned data grid for accuracy and completeness

**Validation Checkpoint**: Results display showing computer names from your environment

### Step 3: Advanced Question Techniques

#### Multi-Sensor Query Construction
\`\`\`
Get Computer Name and IP Address and Operating System from all machines
\`\`\`

**Benefits of Multi-Sensor Queries**:
- Single operation for multiple data points
- Reduced network overhead
- Correlated information in unified result set
- Improved operational efficiency

#### Filtering and Targeting
- Apply computer group filters to limit scope
- Use logical operators for complex conditions
- Implement performance-conscious query design

## Procedure 2: Saved Question Management

### Creating Saved Questions
1. **Build and Test Query**: Create and validate your question thoroughly
2. **Initiate Save**: Click "Save Question" button in the interface
3. **Provide Details**:
   - **Name**: Use descriptive, searchable naming convention
   - **Description**: Include purpose, usage notes, and context
   - **Category**: Assign to appropriate organizational grouping
   - **Permissions**: Configure access controls appropriately

### Best Practices for Saved Questions
- **Naming Convention**: Use consistent, descriptive names (e.g., "SECURITY-RunningProcesses-Weekly")
- **Documentation Standards**: Include clear descriptions and use cases
- **Regular Maintenance**: Audit and update saved questions quarterly
- **Permission Management**: Apply principle of least privilege

## Procedure 3: Query Performance Optimization

### Performance Analysis Workflow
1. **Baseline Measurement**: Record initial query execution time
2. **Scope Assessment**: Evaluate target endpoint count and data volume
3. **Sensor Optimization**: Choose most efficient sensors for requirements
4. **Result Limitation**: Apply appropriate limits for large datasets
5. **Performance Validation**: Confirm optimized query meets performance targets

### Optimization Techniques
- **Targeting Efficiency**: Use computer groups to limit scope appropriately
- **Sensor Selection**: Choose lightweight sensors when sufficient
- **Timing Strategy**: Schedule resource-intensive queries during off-peak hours
- **Result Management**: Apply limits to prevent overwhelming data returns

## Procedure 4: Troubleshooting Failed Queries

### Systematic Diagnostic Process
1. **Error Classification**: Identify error type (permissions, timeout, invalid sensor)
2. **Permission Verification**: Confirm user has appropriate sensor access rights
3. **Scope Validation**: Check targeting parameters and endpoint availability  
4. **Network Assessment**: Verify connectivity to target endpoints
5. **Resolution Implementation**: Apply appropriate fix based on diagnosis
6. **Verification Testing**: Confirm resolution with test query execution

### Common Issues and Resolutions
- **Timeout Errors**: Reduce query scope, optimize sensor selection, check network performance
- **Permission Denied**: Verify user roles, confirm sensor access rights, validate RBAC configuration
- **No Results Returned**: Check targeting accuracy, verify endpoint connectivity, validate sensor functionality
- **Performance Issues**: Optimize query complexity, review targeting scope, consider timing adjustments`,
