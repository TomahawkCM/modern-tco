# Session Accomplishments Summary

## Critical Issue Resolved

**Problem**: Content delivery disconnect - only 1-2 questions accessible out of 200+ available
**Root Cause**: questionsService.ts importing from sample-questions instead of imported-questions-master
**Solution**: Fixed import statements in questionsService.ts lines 349 and 365
**Result**: 100% content delivery - all 200+ questions now accessible

## Browser Testing Verification

- Practice Mode shows "Total questions available: 200"
- All 5 TCO domains functional with proper question distribution
- Console logs confirm proper fallback mechanism

## Impact Assessment
