# PHASE 1 CRITICAL FINDING: Explanation System Completely Missing

## Executive Summary
**CONFIRMED**: Practice Mode advertises "immediate feedback, explanations for answers" but provides ZERO educational content when users get questions wrong.

## Test Validation Steps
1. Started Practice Mode session (10 questions generated)
2. Selected wrong answer "No special validation needed" for Question 1 about validation criteria for high-risk production actions
3. Clicked "Go to Next Question"
4. System jumped directly to Question 2 without any feedback/explanation screen

## Critical Gap Analysis
**Advertised Features** (from Practice Mode page):
- "Practice Mode Features: **Immediate feedback, explanations for answers**, no time pressure, and the ability to review questions."

**Actual Implementation**:
- ❌ NO feedback provided for incorrect answers
- ❌ NO explanations of correct answers or concepts  
- ❌ NO educational content between questions
- ✅ Scoring system works (tracks 0% for wrong answers)
- ✅ Question navigation functions properly

## Educational Impact
This represents a **critical educational functionality gap**:
- Students learn nothing when they get questions wrong
- No understanding of why answers are incorrect
- No reinforcement of correct concepts
- Reduces Practice Mode to basic quiz with no learning value

## Technical Evidence
- Score updated correctly (0% after wrong answer)
- Console shows proper question generation (10 questions)
- Navigation works (Question 1 → Question 2 immediately)
- No intermediate screens, modals, or explanation components render

## Recommendation Priority: CRITICAL
The missing explanation system undermines the core educational value proposition of the TCO study platform. Without explanations, students cannot learn from mistakes or understand correct approaches to Tanium operations.
