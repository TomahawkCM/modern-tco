# Webpack Error Analysis - Tanium TCO Modern App

## Investigation Results

- Webpack configuration is actually working correctly with Next.js 15.5.2
- Issues are NOT webpack-related but ESLint + TypeScript configuration problems
- shadcn/ui components properly installed and compatible
- Build process core functionality is sound

## Root Causes Identified

1. ESLint: Deprecated rule "use-unknown-in-catch-clause-variable" in v8.42.0
2. TypeScript: Missing TCODomain.REFINING_TARGETING mappings in analytics component

## Tool Usage Strategy

- Using concurrent Task agents for specialized fixes
- Leveraging Serena MCP for memory and analysis
- TodoWrite for progress tracking
- MultiEdit for efficient file modifications
