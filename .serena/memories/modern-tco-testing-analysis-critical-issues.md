# Modern TCO Testing Analysis - Critical Infrastructure Issues

## Testing Request

User requested comprehensive testing of modern-tco app functionality in browser with error analysis using Serena tools.

## Critical Infrastructure Issues Preventing Testing

### 1. System Resource Overload

**Status**: CRITICAL - System Failure
**Details**:

- 49 Node.js processes running (system limit: 8)
- High CPU usage: 71.75% (limit: 70%)
- Development startup script failing health checks
- Process proliferation causing port conflicts

### 2. Port Conflicts

**Status**: CRITICAL - Network Conflicts
**Occupied Ports**: 3002, 3003, 3004, 3005, 3008, 3011, 3012, 3013
**Impact**: Unable to start development server on any available port
**Root Cause**: Multiple orphaned Node.js processes holding ports

### 3. Development Server Failures

**Status**: CRITICAL - Application Startup Failure
**Issue**: Custom dev-startup.js script has sophisticated health checks that prevent startup when system resources exceed limits
**Health Checks Failing**:

- CPU usage > 70%
- Node.js processes > 8
- Memory pressure detection
- Port availability checks

## Application Architecture Analysis (From Static Files)

### Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15.5.2 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.0+ with strict mode
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI + shadcn/ui components
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom Tanium branding
- **State Management**: React Context + useReducer pattern
- **Validation**: Zod + React Hook Form

### Key Features (Based on Package.json & Config)

1. **Exam System**: TCO (Tanium Certified Operator) certification prep
2. **AI Integration**: Anthropic SDK for question generation
3. **Database Integration**: Supabase with both anon and service keys
4. **Performance Optimization**: GPU acceleration support
5. **Development Tools**: Comprehensive script suite for tasks/migration
6. **PWA Support**: Offline exam functionality
7. **Security**: Proper API key management and authentication

### Build Status

âœ… **Application Successfully Built**: .next directory contains complete build artifacts

- build-manifest.json
- app-build-manifest.json
- Static assets and server components present

### Configuration Analysis

- **TypeScript Config**: Proper path mapping, modern ES2018 target
- **Next.js Config**: GPU optimization, Turbopack integration, performance features
- **Environment**: Production Supabase instance configured

## What Testing Would Cover (When Operational)

### 1. Core Exam Functionality

- Practice mode with unlimited questions
- Mock exam mode with 90-minute timer
- Review mode for incorrect answers
- Question navigation and scoring

### 2. User Interface Testing

- Responsive design across devices
- Dark/light theme switching
- Glassmorphic UI components
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

### 3. Database Integration

- Supabase connection and queries
- User authentication flows
- Progress tracking persistence
- Offline fallback to localStorage

### 4. Performance Testing

- Page load times < 2 seconds
- Bundle size optimization
- Core Web Vitals compliance
- Memory usage monitoring

### 5. Cross-Browser Compatibility

- Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Mobile browser testing
- Progressive Web App features

## Root Cause Analysis

The system is in a degraded state with resource exhaustion preventing any testing. The sophisticated development infrastructure (health checks, process monitoring, GPU optimization) is ironically preventing startup due to the very issues it's designed to detect and prevent.

## Immediate Blockers

1. Cannot start development server due to health check failures
2. All preferred ports occupied by orphaned processes
3. System resource limits exceeded
4. Process cleanup mechanisms not functioning

## Status

ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL**: No testing possible until infrastructure issues resolved
ðŸ“Š **Application Health**: Appears healthy (builds successfully, configs valid)
ðŸ”§ **Infrastructure Health**: Severely compromised
