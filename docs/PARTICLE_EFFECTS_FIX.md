# Particle Effects Implementation Fix

## Issue Resolution: Mouse Interaction with Particles

### Problem Identified
Particles were not connecting to mouse cursor on hover, despite having the correct animation code.

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Canvas Pointer Events**: Canvas had `pointer-events: none` style
2. **Event Listener Scope**: Mouse events were attached to canvas instead of window
3. **Event Capture**: Canvas couldn't receive mouse events due to CSS property

### Solution Implemented
**File**: `src/components/CyberpunkNavigation.tsx`

**Change Made**:
```typescript
// BEFORE (broken)
canvas.addEventListener('mousemove', handleMouseMove)

// AFTER (working)
window.addEventListener('mousemove', handleMouseMove)
```

### Technical Details
- **Mouse Event Range**: 150px connection distance from cursor
- **Connection Style**: `rgba(14, 165, 233, opacity)` cyan lines
- **Mouse Glow**: 50px radius blue gradient effect
- **Particle Brightening**: Particles within 100px increase opacity

### Verification Steps
1. Navigate to dashboard page
2. Move mouse cursor around screen
3. Observe cyan lines connecting particles to cursor
4. Verify blue glow effect follows mouse
5. Confirm particles brighten on proximity

### Next Steps
Apply same particle background system to all app pages for consistent UX.
