## Spaced Repetition Reviews

The **2357 Method** schedules reviews at scientifically optimal intervals.

### How It Works

When you learn a new concept, it's reviewed at these intervals:
- **Day 1**: First review (+1 day from learning)
- **Day 3**: Second review (+2 days)
- **Day 7**: Third review (+4 days)
- **Day 16**: Fourth review (+9 days)
- **Day 35**: Fifth review (+19 days)

**Adaptive Intervals**: System adjusts based on your performance:
- Struggling (<70% retention): 30% shorter intervals
- Normal (70-90%): Standard intervals
- Mastered (>90%): 30% longer intervals

### Starting a Review Session

1. **Check Dashboard** for "Reviews Due Today"
2. **Click "Start Review Session"**
3. **Answer each question** (multiple choice or true/false)
4. **Get immediate feedback** with explanations
5. **Complete session** to update retention scores

### Review Session Flow

```
1. System shows 5-15 questions due today
2. You answer each question
3. Immediate feedback + explanation
4. Points awarded for correct answers
5. Retention scores update
6. Next review automatically scheduled
```

### Performance Indicators

- **Green (90%+)**: Mastered - review less frequently
- **Blue (70-89%)**: Good - normal schedule
- **Yellow (50-69%)**: Fair - more frequent reviews
- **Red (<50%)**: Struggling - much more frequent reviews
