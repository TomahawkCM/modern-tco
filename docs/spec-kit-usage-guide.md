# GitHub Spec Kit Usage Guide

## Quick Start with Spec-Driven Development

### Core Concept

Spec-Driven Development "flips the script" on traditional coding by making specifications the executable foundation of your project, not just temporary scaffolding.

## Workflow Overview

### 1. Specification Phase (`/specify`)

**Purpose**: Define project intent and requirements before implementation

**PowerShell:**

```powershell
# Initialize new spec-driven project
uvx specify-cli.py init tanium-tco-enhancement

# Or initialize in current directory
uvx specify-cli.py init --here
```

**Unix/Linux:**

```bash
# Initialize new spec-driven project
uvx specify-cli.py init tanium-tco-enhancement

# Or initialize in current directory
uvx specify-cli.py init --here
```

**What this creates**:

- Project specification document
- AI assistant integration setup
- Template structure for spec-driven development
- Git repository initialization (optional)

### 2. Planning Phase (`/plan`)

**Purpose**: Transform specifications into actionable technical plans

**AI Integration**: Works with Claude Code to:

- Analyze specification requirements
- Generate technical architecture
- Identify implementation patterns
- Create development roadmap

### 3. Task Breakdown (`/tasks`)

**Purpose**: Convert plans into specific, manageable implementation tasks

**Output**:

- Prioritized task list
- Implementation dependencies
- Resource requirements
- Success criteria for each task

## Integration with TCO Project

### Use Cases for Tanium TCO Study Platform

```

#### 2. Feature Enhancement Planning

```
/plan "Gamification Engine for TCO Study Platform"

- Mobile-responsive implementation
```

#### 3. Assessment Development Tasks

```
/tasks "Create Domain 2 Practice Questions"
- Question bank structure
- Difficulty progression algorithms
- Performance analytics integration
- Adaptive learning pathways
```

### Integration with Existing Workflow

#### SPARC + Spec Kit Methodology

1. **Specification** (Spec Kit `/specify`) → Requirements analysis
2. **Pseudocode** (Spec Kit `/plan`) → Technical planning  
3. **Architecture** (SPARC `architect`) → System design
4. **Refinement** (Spec Kit `/tasks`) → Implementation breakdown
5. **Completion** (SPARC `integration`) → Testing and deployment

#### SuperClaude Framework Enhancement

- **Persona Integration**: Spec Kit works with all 11 specialized personas
- **MCP Coordination**: Enhances Context7, Sequential, and Magic integration
- **Wave Orchestration**: Perfect for multi-stage specification refinement
- **Quality Gates**: Adds specification validation to 8-step process

## Advanced Features

### AI Assistant Selection

During initialization, Spec Kit detects and integrates with:

- ✅ **Claude Code** (already active in your environment)
- **GitHub Copilot** (if available)
- **Gemini** (if configured)

### Template System

Spec Kit downloads project templates from GitHub based on:

- Project type (web app, CLI tool, library, etc.)
- Technology stack preferences
- Development methodology (0-to-1, iterative, creative)

### Multi-Phase Development Support

#### 0-to-1 Development

- Green-field project creation
- Comprehensive requirement gathering
- Architecture from scratch
- Full specification to implementation pipeline

#### Creative Exploration

- Experimental feature development
- Rapid prototyping workflows
- Design thinking integration
- Innovation-focused specifications

#### Iterative Enhancement

- Existing project improvement
- Feature addition planning
- Technical debt reduction
- Performance optimization specs

## Best Practices

### Specification Writing

1. **Intent-First**: Focus on "what" and "why" before "how"
2. **Measurable Outcomes**: Define success criteria upfront
3. **User-Centered**: Consider end-user experience in all specs
4. **Iterative Refinement**: Specifications evolve with understanding

### AI Collaboration

1. **Context Sharing**: Provide rich context for better AI interpretation
2. **Iterative Feedback**: Use AI suggestions to refine specifications
3. **Domain Expertise**: Leverage AI knowledge of best practices
4. **Quality Validation**: Use AI to identify specification gaps

### Project Integration

1. **Version Control**: Treat specifications as first-class code artifacts
2. **Documentation Sync**: Keep specs aligned with implementation
3. **Team Collaboration**: Share specifications for alignment
4. **Continuous Evolution**: Update specs as project evolves

## Example Workflows

### TCO Study Module Development

**PowerShell:**

```powershell
# 1. Specify new interactive lab exercise
uvx specify-cli.py init --here
> /specify "Tanium Query Builder Interactive Lab"
  - Domain 1: Asking Questions focus
  - Step-by-step query construction
  - Real-time validation feedback
  - Progress tracking integration

# 2. Generate technical plan
> /plan
  - React component architecture
  - State management strategy  
  - API integration requirements
  - Testing approach

# 3. Break down implementation
> /tasks
  - Create QueryBuilder component
  - Implement validation engine
  - Integrate progress tracking
  - Add accessibility features
  - Write comprehensive tests
```

**Unix/Linux:**

```bash
# 1. Specify new interactive lab exercise
uvx specify-cli.py init --here
> /specify "Tanium Query Builder Interactive Lab"
  - Domain 1: Asking Questions focus
  - Step-by-step query construction
  - Real-time validation feedback
  - Progress tracking integration

# 2. Generate technical plan
> /plan
  - React component architecture
  - State management strategy  
  - API integration requirements
  - Testing approach

# 3. Break down implementation
> /tasks
  - Create QueryBuilder component
  - Implement validation engine
  - Integrate progress tracking
  - Add accessibility features
  - Write comprehensive tests
```

### Assessment System Enhancement

```bash
# 1. Specify adaptive difficulty system
> /specify "Adaptive Question Difficulty Algorithm"
  - Performance-based question selection
  - Spaced repetition integration
  - Weakness identification
  - Study path personalization

# 2. Plan implementation approach
> /plan
  - Machine learning model selection
  - Data collection requirements
  - Real-time processing pipeline
  - Privacy and data protection

# 3. Create development tasks
> /tasks
  - Implement scoring algorithm
  - Build recommendation engine
  - Create analytics dashboard
  - Integrate with existing system
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Specification too vague**: Add specific outcomes and constraints
- **Plan too complex**: Break into smaller, manageable phases
- **Tasks overwhelming**: Further decompose large tasks
- **AI context lost**: Provide more domain-specific information

### Success Indicators

- ✅ Specifications are actionable and measurable
- ✅ Plans align with project constraints and goals
- ✅ Tasks are implementable within time/resource limits
- ✅ AI suggestions enhance rather than replace human insight

## Next Steps

### Once Full Installation is Complete

1. **Initialize TCO project**: Create specifications for current development
2. **Migrate existing plans**: Convert current roadmaps to spec format
3. **Team onboarding**: Train team members on spec-driven methodology  
4. **Process integration**: Merge with existing SPARC/SuperClaude workflows
5. **Continuous improvement**: Evolve specifications based on outcomes

### Advanced Usage

- **Custom templates**: Create TCO-specific project templates
- **AI fine-tuning**: Enhance AI understanding of Tanium domain
- **Workflow automation**: Integrate with CI/CD pipelines
- **Analytics integration**: Track specification success rates

The Spec Kit methodology will significantly enhance our development process by ensuring clear intent, comprehensive planning, and AI-augmented implementation guidance.
