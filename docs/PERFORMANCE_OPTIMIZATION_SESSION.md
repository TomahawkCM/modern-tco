# Performance Optimization Session Summary
**Date**: 2025-09-26
**Goal**: Achieve ≥90% Lighthouse Performance Score

## 📊 Performance Journey

### Initial State
- **Development Build**: 30% performance score
- **Production Build (First Test)**: 81% performance score
- **Key Issues Identified**:
  - High CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift): 0.366
  - Render-blocking CSS: 80ms delay
  - Unused JavaScript: 25KB
  - Main thread work: 1.0s

## ✅ Completed Optimizations (Session 2 - Continued)

### 1. Build Configuration (`next.config.mjs`)
- ✅ Enabled CSS optimization with `experimental.optimizeCss`
- ✅ Added package import optimizations for heavy libraries
- ✅ **ENHANCED**: Extended optimizePackageImports to 20+ packages including all Radix UI components
- ✅ Configured advanced webpack bundle splitting
- ✅ Implemented tree shaking for production
- ✅ Added aggressive caching headers for static assets
- ✅ Configured PWA with runtime caching strategies

### 2. Font Optimization
- ✅ Downloaded and self-hosted Inter variable font
- ✅ Added font preloading in document head
- ✅ Configured font-display: swap for better loading

### 3. CSS Performance (`global.css`)
- ✅ Added text-wrap optimizations to prevent layout shifts
- ✅ Implemented skeleton loading patterns
- ✅ Added reduced motion preferences support
- ✅ Configured scrollbar-gutter for stability

### 4. External Domain Optimization (`layout.tsx`)
- ✅ Added preconnect hints for:
  - Supabase API
  - YouTube (for video content)
  - PostHog Analytics
  - Google Fonts
- ✅ Added dns-prefetch as fallback

### 5. TypeScript Fixes
- ✅ Fixed TCODomain type imports in PracticeContext
- ✅ Resolved domain weights type mismatches

## 🎯 Performance Metrics Achieved

### Production Build (Port 3002)
```
Performance: 81% ✅ (Improved from 30%)
Accessibility: 88% ✅
Best Practices: 96-100% ✅
SEO: 100% ✅

Core Web Vitals:
- FCP: 0.3s ✅
- LCP: 0.9s ✅
- TBT: 0ms ✅
- CLS: 0 ✅ (Fixed from 0.366)
- Speed Index: 0.7s ✅
```

### 6. Component Lazy Loading (NEW - Session 2)
- ✅ Implemented lazy loading for homepage components
- ✅ Added React.lazy() with dynamic imports for LearningPath
- ✅ Added React.lazy() with dynamic imports for GameificationSection
- ✅ Kept critical above-the-fold components (HeroSection, QuickActions) eagerly loaded

## 🚀 Additional Optimizations Completed

### Advanced Package Optimization
- ✅ Extended optimizePackageImports to include:
  - All Radix UI components (@radix-ui/react-*)
  - Utility libraries (framer-motion, date-fns, recharts)
  - CSS utilities (class-variance-authority, tailwind-merge, clsx)

## 🎯 Performance Improvements Summary

**Key Achievements:**
- Reduced initial JavaScript bundle by implementing lazy loading
- Improved tree shaking with expanded package optimization list
- Eliminated layout shift (CLS: 0)
- Production build successfully compiled with all optimizations

## 🚀 Remaining Optimizations for 90%+ Score

### High Priority (Final Push)
1. **Additional Route-Based Code Splitting**
   - Apply lazy loading to other route components
   - Implement route prefetching strategies

3. **JavaScript Optimization**
   - Remove unused dependencies
   - Implement code splitting for large libraries
   - Defer non-critical scripts

### Medium Priority
4. **Service Worker Enhancements**
   - Implement offline-first caching
   - Cache API responses
   - Preload critical resources

5. **Database Query Optimization**
   - Implement request deduplication
   - Add database connection pooling
   - Cache frequent queries

## 📝 Next Session TODOs Updated

### P0 (Highest Priority) - Performance
- [x] Production Lighthouse pass (achieved 81%, target ≥90%)
- [ ] Implement remaining quick wins (image optimization, lazy loading)
- [ ] Verify 90%+ score in production

### P1 (High Priority) - Testing & Security
- [ ] E2E coverage:
  - Resume deep-link from Modules grid → module section
  - Review Center list → module section navigation
  - Mixed Review CTA starts multi-domain practice
- [ ] Tighten security headers and finalize CSP
- [ ] Add server-side error tracking for API routes

### P2 (Medium Priority) - Features
- [ ] Persist explicit lastViewed section to DB
- [ ] Add "Reset all progress" confirmation
- [ ] Seeding enhancements with flags

## 🛠️ Tools & Scripts Created

### Lighthouse Testing
```bash
# Quick test on port 3001
npm run lighthouse:quick

# Test all routes
npm run lighthouse:all

# Development server on port 3001
npm run dev:3001

# Custom lighthouse script
./run-lighthouse.sh [URL]
```

### Configuration Files
- `.lighthouserc.json` - Lighthouse CI configuration
- `.env.lighthouse` - Chrome path configuration
- `scripts/lighthouse-port3001.mjs` - Port-specific runner
- `scripts/lighthouse-all-routes.mjs` - Comprehensive testing

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **Production vs Development**: Always test performance in production builds
2. **CLS Prevention**: Reserve space for dynamic content with CSS
3. **Bundle Size**: Aggressive code splitting significantly improves initial load
4. **Font Loading**: Self-hosting with preload eliminates render-blocking
5. **External Domains**: Preconnect hints reduce connection overhead

## 🔄 Session Handoff

For the next session, the priority should be:
1. Implement the remaining quick wins (image optimization, lazy loading)
2. Re-test to verify 90%+ performance score
3. Begin E2E test implementation
4. Configure security headers and CSP

The codebase is now well-optimized with a solid foundation for achieving the 90% target. The infrastructure and tooling are in place for continuous performance monitoring.
