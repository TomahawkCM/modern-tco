### Exam Topics (Research Verified)

**Core Areas Confirmed**:

1. Platform architecture and basic functions
2. Data collection and endpoint querying  
3. Tanium Console navigation and dashboard usage

```

**PLANNING REQUIREMENT**: Verify actual implementation status before architectural decisions.

#### Technology Stack Assessment

**Framework Analysis Needed**:

- Next.js 15.5.2 implementation completeness
- TypeScript configuration and strict mode compliance
- Supabase integration status and RLS setup
- Component library (shadcn/ui) implementation
- Testing framework setup and coverage

### Gap Analysis Framework

#### Learning Platform Requirements vs Current State

**CRITICAL ANALYSIS NEEDED**:

1. **Console Simulation Requirements**
   - **SPECIFIED**: Interactive Tanium console simulation environment
   - **CURRENT STATUS**: UNKNOWN - requires verification
   - **GAP ASSESSMENT**: Pending functionality testing

2. **Assessment Engine Requirements**  
   - **SPECIFIED**: 105-minute exam simulation with adaptive difficulty
   - **CURRENT STATUS**: UNKNOWN - requires verification
   - **GAP ASSESSMENT**: Pending functionality testing

3. **Content Management Requirements**
   - **SPECIFIED**: Comprehensive study materials for verified exam topics
   - **CURRENT STATUS**: UNKNOWN - requires content audit
   - **GAP ASSESSMENT**: Pending content verification

4. **Progress Tracking Requirements**
   - **SPECIFIED**: Analytics for certification readiness
   - **CURRENT STATUS**: UNKNOWN - requires feature testing
   - **GAP ASSESSMENT**: Pending analytics verification

### Technical Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Evidence Gathering (Current Priority)

**Immediate Actions**:

1. **Functionality Verification Testing**
   - Test Next.js development server startup
   - Verify database connectivity and schema
   - Test component rendering and interactions
   - Validate build processes and type checking

2. **Content Audit**
   - Verify study materials align with official exam topics
   - Check for outdated content referencing unverified 5-domain structure
   - Validate lab exercises match actual Tanium platform capabilities

3. **Performance Benchmarking**
   - Measure current load times and bundle sizes
   - Test accessibility compliance levels
   - Verify mobile responsiveness implementation

#### Phase 2: Architecture Design (Post-Verification)

**Conditional Planning** (depends on Phase 1 findings):

1. **Console Simulation Architecture**
   - **IF** current implementation exists: Assess quality and extend
   - **IF** not implemented: Design interactive simulation engine
   - **Requirements**: Real-time validation, progress tracking, accessibility

2. **Assessment Engine Architecture**
   - **IF** current implementation exists: Verify against 105-minute format
   - **IF** not implemented: Design adaptive examination system
   - **Requirements**: Performance analytics, spaced repetition, certification readiness

3. **Content Management Architecture**
   - **IF** current content exists: Audit for official topic alignment
   - **IF** content missing: Develop evidence-based study materials
   - **Requirements**: Topic coverage, interactive elements, progress tracking

### Implementation Patterns (Evidence-Based)

#### Pattern 1: Incremental Enhancement (If Foundation Exists)

**Conditions**: Current implementation has functional baseline
**Approach**:

- Extend existing architecture
- Improve performance and accessibility
- Add missing certification-specific features
- Maintain backward compatibility

#### Pattern 2: Strategic Rebuild (If Foundation Inadequate)

**Conditions**: Current implementation doesn't meet specifications
**Approach**:

- Preserve working components
- Redesign core learning engine
- Implement certification-focused architecture
- Staged migration approach

#### Pattern 3: Hybrid Development (Mixed State)

**Conditions**: Some components functional, others missing/inadequate
**Approach**:

- Component-by-component assessment
- Selective preservation and rebuilding
- Integrated testing throughout process
- Risk-based prioritization

### Resource Requirements Planning

#### Development Effort Estimation (Post-Assessment)

**Estimation Framework**:

- **Console Simulation**: 2-8 weeks (depends on current state)
- **Assessment Engine**: 3-6 weeks (depends on current state)
- **Content Development**: 4-12 weeks (depends on content audit)
- **Performance Optimization**: 2-4 weeks (depends on current performance)
- **Accessibility Implementation**: 2-6 weeks (depends on current compliance)

#### Risk Assessment Matrix

**HIGH RISK**:

- Database connectivity issues preventing progress
- PowerShell Core compatibility problems
- Fundamental architecture incompatibility with specifications

**MEDIUM RISK**:

- Content misalignment with official exam topics
- Performance not meeting specified requirements
- Accessibility compliance gaps

**LOW RISK**:

- UI/UX refinements
- Minor feature additions
- Documentation updates

### Quality Assurance Framework

#### Validation Checkpoints

1. **Functional Validation**: All specified features work as intended
2. **Performance Validation**: Load times and responsiveness meet specifications
3. **Accessibility Validation**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance verified
4. **Content Validation**: Study materials align with official exam topics
5. **User Experience Validation**: Platform meets usability expectations

#### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Testing**: Component-level functionality
- **Integration Testing**: Feature interaction validation
