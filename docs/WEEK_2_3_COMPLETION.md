# Week 2.3 - Active Recall Question Bank ‚úÖ

**Duration**: 2 hours
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Build**: ‚úì Compiled successfully in 15.9s

---

## üéØ Implementation Summary

Week 2.3 replaces generic "Remembered/Need Review" prompts with **targeted active recall questions** from a question bank, dramatically improving learning effectiveness through specific retrieval practice.

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. Question Bank System (`src/lib/questionBank.ts`)

**Core Data Structure**:
```typescript
interface Question {
  id: string;
  moduleId: string;           // Links to content module
  sectionId: string;          // Links to micro-section
  concept: string;            // Specific concept being tested
  question: string;
  type: "multiple-choice" | "true-false" | "fill-blank";
  options?: string[];
  correctAnswer: string;
  explanation: string;
  difficulty: "easy" | "medium" | "hard";
  tags?: string[];
}
```

**Key Functions**:
- `getQuestionsForReview()` - Smart question selection with fallback hierarchy
- `getRandomQuestion()` - Single question retrieval
- `getQuestionBank()` / `saveQuestionBank()` - localStorage persistence
- `addQuestions()` - Add questions to bank with deduplication
- `importLegacyQuestions()` - Convert old exam format
- `getDefaultQuestions()` - 17 high-quality default questions

**Section Linking Functions** (NEW):
- `getQuestionsForSection()` - Get all questions for a specific section
- `getAvailableSections()` - List all sections with question coverage
- `getSectionQuestionCount()` - Count questions per section
- `hasSectionQuestions()` - Check if section has questions

**Statistics**:
- `getQuestionBankStats()` - Breakdown by module, difficulty, type

### 2. ReviewSession Enhancement (`src/components/study/ReviewSession.tsx`)

**New State Management**:
```typescript
const [currentQuestion, setCurrentQuestion] = useState<Question | null>(null);
const [selectedAnswer, setSelectedAnswer] = useState<string | null>(null);
const [useQuestions, setUseQuestions] = useState(true);
```

**Question Loading Logic**:
- Automatically loads questions matching current review item
- Falls back to generic active recall if no questions available
- Resets selection when moving between items

**UI Components Added**:

1. **Question Display**:
   - Type badge (Multiple Choice / True-False)
   - Difficulty badge
   - Clear question text

2. **Answer Options**:
   - **True/False**: CheckCircle2 / XCircle buttons
   - **Multiple Choice**: Lettered options (A, B, C, D)
   - Selection highlighting
   - Submit Answer button

3. **Result Feedback** (Enhanced):
   - Shows the question that was asked
   - Displays correct answer (green highlight)
   - Shows student's answer if incorrect (orange highlight)
   - Comprehensive explanation with BookOpen icon
   - Concept and difficulty badges

### 3. Question Import Utility (`scripts/import-to-question-bank.ts`)

**CLI Tool Features**:
- Import from JSON or legacy formats
- Domain and difficulty mapping
- Validation with error reporting
- Statistics display
- TypeScript and JSON output generation

**Usage**:
```bash
# Import direct JSON format
npx tsx scripts/import-to-question-bank.ts data/questions.json

# Import legacy format
npx tsx scripts/import-to-question-bank.ts data/legacy.json --format=legacy
```

**Outputs**:
- `src/data/question-bank/imported-YYYY-MM-DD.json`
- `src/data/question-bank/imported-YYYY-MM-DD.ts`

### 4. Default Question Coverage

**17 High-Quality Questions** across core concepts:

**Platform Foundation** (5 questions):
- Linear Chain Architecture (3 questions)
- Query Performance (1 question)
- Architecture Benefits (1 question)

**Asking Questions** (5 questions):
- Query Syntax (1 question)
- Sensors (1 question)
- Question Construction (1 question)
- Filters (2 questions)

**Taking Action** (3 questions):
- Tanium Packages (1 question)
- Package Deployment (1 question)
- Action Scheduling (1 question)

**Troubleshooting** (2 questions):

- Client Connectivity (1 question)

## üìä Research Foundation

**Active Recall Testing**: One of the most effective learning strategies (Roediger & Karpicke, 2006):
- **50% better** long-term retention vs re-reading
- **Retrieval practice effect**: Testing strengthens memory more than studying
- **Specificity matters**: Targeted questions > generic prompts

**Question Design Principles**:
- Clear, unambiguous questions
- Detailed explanations for immediate feedback
- Difficulty matched to spaced repetition progress
- Multiple question types for variety

## üîÑ Integration with Previous Weeks

### Week 1: Micro-Section Detection
Questions linked to micro-sections via `moduleId` and `sectionId`

### Week 2.1: Spaced Repetition (2357)
Questions selected at optimal review intervals

### Week 2.2: Adaptive Difficulty
Question difficulty matches student performance:
- Struggling (< 70% retention) ‚Üí easier questions
- Normal (70-90%) ‚Üí medium difficulty
- Mastered (> 90%) ‚Üí harder questions

## üéì Usage Examples

### For Students (Review Session):

**Before Week 2.3** (Generic):
```
Review Item: "Linear Chain Architecture"

Can you recall the key points about Linear Chain Architecture?

[Need Review] [Remembered]
```

**After Week 2.3** (Targeted):
```
Review Item: "Linear Chain Architecture"

[Multiple Choice] [Difficulty: easy]

What is the primary advantage of Tanium's linear chain architecture?

A. It uses less disk space than traditional solutions
B. It scales to query thousands of endpoints in seconds with minimal server load ‚úì
C. It requires no network connectivity
D. It automatically updates all software

[Submit Answer]

--- After answering ---

‚úì Correct Answer:
"It scales to query thousands of endpoints in seconds with minimal server load"

‚úèÔ∏è Explanation:
"The linear chain architecture allows Tanium to scale exponentially by using
each endpoint as a relay point, enabling rapid queries across massive
environments without overwhelming the server."
```

### For Developers (Question Creation):

```typescript
import { addQuestions, type Question } from "@/lib/questionBank";

const newQuestions: Question[] = [
  {
    id: "aq-nl-6",
    moduleId: "asking-questions",
    sectionId: "natural-language",
    concept: "Sensor Basics",
    question: "What programming languages can Tanium sensors be written in?",
    type: "multiple-choice",
    options: [
      "Only Python",
      "PowerShell, VBScript, JavaScript, and Python",
      "Only JavaScript",
      "Only VBScript"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "PowerShell, VBScript, JavaScript, and Python",
    explanation: "Tanium sensors are highly flexible and can be written in multiple languages including PowerShell, VBScript, JavaScript, and Python, allowing administrators to use their preferred scripting language.",
    difficulty: "medium",
    tags: ["sensors", "languages"]
  }
];

addQuestions(newQuestions);
```

### For Content Authors (Section Linking):

```typescript
import {
  getAvailableSections,
  getSectionQuestionCount,
  hasSectionQuestions
} from "@/lib/questionBank";

// Check which sections have questions
const sections = getAvailableSections("asking-questions");
console.log(sections);
// [
//   {
//     moduleId: "asking-questions",
//     sectionId: "natural-language",
//     questionCount: 5,
//     concepts: ["Query Syntax", "Sensors", "Filters"]
//   }
// ]

// Check specific section
const count = getSectionQuestionCount("asking-questions", "natural-language");
console.log(`Section has ${count} questions`);

// Conditionally show question prompt
if (hasSectionQuestions(moduleId, sectionId)) {
  // Show "Practice with questions" button
}
```

## üöÄ Scaling Plan (4,108+ Questions)

### Phase 1: Import Legacy Questions
```bash
# Run existing exam import
npx tsx scripts/import-questions.ts

# Convert to question bank format
npx tsx scripts/import-to-question-bank.ts \
  src/data/imported-questions-master.json \
  --format=legacy
```

### Phase 2: Organize by Module
- **Asking Questions** (~900 questions, 22%)
- **Refining Questions** (~945 questions, 23%)
- **Taking Action** (~616 questions, 15%)
- **Navigation Modules** (~945 questions, 23%)
- **Reporting Export** (~698 questions, 17%)

### Phase 3: Link to Micro-Sections
Map each question to specific MDX content sections using `sectionId`

### Phase 4: Quality Assurance
- Validate explanations are clear
- Ensure difficulty matches content
- Test question rotation variety

## üìà Expected Learning Outcomes
