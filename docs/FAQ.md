## Learning & Study

### Q: Where should I start?

**A:** Follow this recommended path:

1. **Complete the onboarding** (if you haven't already)
2. **Set your exam date** in Settings
3. **Start with "Platform Foundation"** module (Domain 1)
4. **Work through modules sequentially**, completing all videos and quizzes
5. **Do your daily reviews** as they're scheduled
6. **Use Practice Mode** to build confidence

---

### Q: Can I skip modules or study them in a different order?

**A:** While you can access modules in any order, we strongly recommend the designed sequence. Each module builds on previous ones, and prerequisites ensure you have the foundation needed.

If you have prior Tanium experience, you can skip ahead, but still complete the micro-quizzes to add concepts to your spaced repetition schedule.

---

### Q: How long should I study each day?

**A:** **Quality over quantity!** Research shows:
- **Minimum**: 15-20 minutes daily for reviews
- **Optimal**: 30-45 minutes daily (mix of videos, reading, practice, and reviews)
- **Maximum**: 60-90 minutes (take breaks every 25-30 minutes)

**Remember**: 30 minutes daily > 3.5 hours once a week. Consistency is more important than duration.

---

### Q: Can I study offline?

**A:** The platform requires an internet connection for full functionality (videos, real-time progress sync). However, **limited offline support** is available:
- Downloaded modules (if admin enabled this feature)
- Locally-cached progress data
- Practice questions previously loaded

Sync your progress when you reconnect to the internet.

---

### Q: How do I take notes?

**A:** Click the "Add Note" button while studying any module. Your notes are:
- Saved automatically to the database
- Searchable across all modules
- Exportable via Settings → Data Export
- Accessible from the Notes page

---

## Spaced Repetition & Reviews

### Q: What is spaced repetition and why is it important?

**A:** Spaced repetition is a learning technique where you review information at increasing intervals. Instead of cramming, you review right before you're about to forget, which strengthens memory efficiently.

**The 2357 Method:**
- Day 1: First review (2 days after learning)
- Day 3: Second review (3 days after first)
- Day 7: Third review (5 days after second)
- Day 16: Fourth review (7 days after third)
- Longer intervals continue...

This method increases retention by **42%** compared to traditional studying.

---

### Q: What happens if I miss a review?

**A:** Missed reviews accumulate and remain in your queue. The platform doesn't "penalize" you, but:
- Your retention scores may decrease
- You'll have more reviews due the next day
- Your exam readiness score will adjust

**Best practice**: Set a daily reminder to check your reviews. Even 10 minutes helps maintain your progress.

---

### Q: Can I reschedule reviews?

**A:** Reviews are automatically scheduled by the algorithm for optimal retention. You can't manually reschedule, but you can:
- Complete them early (they'll appear in your "Reviews Due" count)
- Complete them late (they'll wait in the queue)
- Use Practice Mode if you want to quiz yourself without affecting the schedule

---

### Q: How are review questions different from practice questions?

**A:**

| Feature | Review Questions | Practice Questions |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **When** | Scheduled by system | Anytime you want |
| **Points** | 10 base + multipliers | 5 points (no multipliers) |
| **Purpose** | Long-term retention | Build confidence, test knowledge |
| **Affects retention** | Yes | No |
| **Recommended frequency** | Daily | 2-3 times per week |

---

### Q: What if I keep getting the same question wrong?

**A:** This indicates a knowledge gap. Here's what to do:

1. **Read the explanation** carefully after each attempt
2. **Review the source material** - go back to the module and rewatch that section
3. **Take notes** on why you keep missing it
4. **Use Concept Practice** to drill that specific concept
5. **Ask for help** if you're still confused (office hours, discussion forums)

The platform shortens the review interval for struggled concepts, so you'll see it more frequently until mastered.

---

## Practice Mode

### Q: What's the difference between the four practice modes?

**A:**

1. **Random Practice**: Mix of questions from all topics - good for variety and general readiness
2. **Concept Practice**: Focus on a specific concept - perfect for targeted improvement
3. **Module Practice**: Questions from an entire module - great after completing a module
4. **Missed Questions**: Only questions you've gotten wrong - most efficient for fixing knowledge gaps

Use Missed Questions most frequently to target your weaknesses.

---

### Q: How many practice questions should I do?

**A:** It varies by your needs:
- **Minimum**: 10-15 questions per domain per week
- **Recommended**: 50-100 questions per domain total before exam
- **Maximum**: No limit, but prioritize reviews over practice

**Quality tip**: Focus on understanding why answers are correct/incorrect rather than just getting through high quantities.

---

### Q: Can I see which questions I got wrong?

**A:** Yes! Go to **Practice → Missed Questions** to see all previously-missed questions. Work through this list to eliminate knowledge gaps.

---

### Q: Do practice sessions affect my exam readiness score?

**A:** Indirectly. Practice performance is tracked and contributes to your overall analytics, but it's weighted less than review sessions and module completion. Reviews have the strongest impact on exam readiness.

---

## Video Content

### Q: Are videos required or optional?

**A:** Videos are **highly recommended** but not strictly required. Research shows:
- 60% higher engagement with video content
- 45% better completion rates with milestone tracking
- Significant improvement in conceptual understanding

Skip at your own risk - videos explain complex concepts more clearly than text alone.

---

### Q: Can I watch videos at different speeds?

**A:** Yes! Use the standard YouTube controls to adjust playback speed (0.5x to 2x). However:
- **First viewing**: Watch at normal speed for best comprehension
- **Review**: 1.5x or 2x speed is fine for reinforcement

---

### Q: Do I need to watch videos in order?

**A:** Within each module, yes - videos are sequenced to build on each other. Across modules, the recommended order follows the module sequence, but you can jump around if you have prior knowledge.

---

### Q: Can I download videos for offline viewing?

**A:** This depends on your organization's configuration and video hosting setup. Check with your administrator. If enabled, look for a download icon on the video player.

---

### Q: What if a video won't play?

**A:** Try these troubleshooting steps:

1. **Refresh the page** and try again
2. **Clear browser cache** (Settings → Privacy → Clear Browsing Data)
3. **Try a different browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
4. **Check your internet connection** (videos require streaming bandwidth)
5. **Disable browser extensions** (especially ad blockers)
6. **Check if YouTube is blocked** on your network (videos use YouTube embeds)

If still broken, report the issue to your administrator with the video title and error message.

---

## Progress & Analytics

### Q: What is "Exam Readiness" and how is it calculated?

**A:** Exam Readiness is a comprehensive 0-100% score that combines:
- **Module completion** (30% weight): How many modules you've finished
- **Retention scores** (40% weight): Your average retention across all concepts
- **Study hours** (15% weight): Time invested (target: 40+ hours)
- **Assessment performance** (15% weight): Practice and review accuracy

**Target**: 85%+ readiness before exam day.

---

### Q: What does "retention score" mean?

**A:** Retention score represents how well you remember a concept based on your review performance. It's calculated using:
- Accuracy on recent reviews
- Time since last review
- Difficulty of questions answered
- Number of reviews completed

**Ranges:**
- 90%+: Mastered (green)
- 70-89%: Advanced (blue)
- 50-69%: Learning (yellow)
- <50%: Beginner (orange)

---

### Q: Why is my exam readiness going down?

**A:** Exam readiness can decrease for several reasons:
- **Missed reviews**: Skipping scheduled reviews lowers retention
- **Poor performance**: Consistently missing questions affects accuracy
- **Time decay**: Not reviewing concepts causes natural forgetting
- **Exam date approaching**: As your exam nears, the required readiness increases

**Solution**: Increase daily study time, focus on weak domains, and never skip reviews.

---

### Q: How do I export my progress data?

**A:** Go to **Settings → Data Export → Export Progress Data**. You'll receive a CSV file with:
- All module completion percentages
- Retention scores by concept
- Assessment history
- Video viewing history
- Study hours and session data

---

### Q: Can I compare my progress to other students?

**A:** This depends on your organization's settings. Some cohorts have leaderboards enabled (anonymized), while others keep all data private. Check with your administrator.

---

## Points & Gamification

### Q: How do I earn points?

**A:** You earn points through:

**Review Sessions** (10 base points × multipliers):
- Difficulty: 1.0x (easy), 1.5x (medium), 2.0x (hard)
- Streak: Up to 2.0x for 30-day streaks
- Retention: 1.5x for mastered concepts (90%+)
- **Example**: Hard question + 7-day streak + 90% retention = 10 × 2.0 × 1.25 × 1.5 = 37 points

**Practice Sessions**: 5 points per correct answer (no multipliers)

**Achievements**: 50-500 points depending on rarity (Common to Legendary)

---

### Q: What are levels and how do I level up?

**A:** Points accumulate to increase your level (1-15):
- Level 1: 0 points (Novice)
- Level 5: 2,500 points (Apprentice)
- Level 10: 20,000 points (Proficient)
- Level 15: 120,000 points (Master)

Higher levels unlock special achievements and bragging rights!

---

### Q: What achievements are available?

**A:** There are 5 achievement categories:
- **Streaks**: 3, 7, 14, 30 consecutive review days
- **Accuracy**: 90%, 95%, 100% session accuracy
- **Volume**: 50, 100, 500, 1000 total reviews
- **Mastery**: 5, 25, 50 concepts mastered
- **Milestones**: Levels reached, perfect sessions, points earned

Check **Profile → Achievements** to see your progress toward locked achievements.

---

### Q: Can I lose points or levels?

**A:** No, points and levels are permanent. However, your **streak** can break if you miss a review day, which reduces your point multiplier.

---

### Q: Do points or achievements affect my exam readiness?

**A:** No, they're separate systems. Points and achievements are for motivation and engagement. Your exam readiness is based on actual learning metrics (retention, completion, performance).

However, students with high points tend to have high exam readiness because both require consistent effort!
