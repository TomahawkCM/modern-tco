# Supabase Permissions Issue - Owner Account

## Current Situation

- **You are**: Project owner (only user)
- **Issue**: MCP operations returning "insufficient privileges"
- **Access Token**: `sbp_c47066b04eedb9a43acadef870a35230c59e69f2` (configured)

## Root Cause Analysis

As the project owner, you should have full permissions. The issue is likely:

### 1. **Access Token Scope Limitation**

Your access token might not have the required scopes enabled.

**Solution**: Regenerate access token with full scopes:

1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Access Tokens**
3. Delete current token
4. Create new token with **ALL SCOPES** checked:
   - ✅ Read access to organizations
   - ✅ Read access to projects
   - ✅ Write access to projects
   - ✅ Read access to secrets
   - ✅ Write access to secrets
   - ✅ Read access to database
   - ✅ Write access to database
   - ✅ Read access to functions
   - ✅ Write access to functions

### 2. **Management API vs Client API**

Some MCP operations use the **Management API** which requires different permissions than the client API.

**Check**: Ensure your token has **Management API** access, not just client access.

### 3. **Organization vs Project Level**

If your project is under an organization, you need **Organization Owner** role, not just project member.

**Solution**:

- Check if project is under an organization
- Ensure you're organization owner if applicable

## Quick Fix Steps

### Step 1: Generate New Access Token

```bash
# Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens
# Create new token with ALL permissions
```

### Step 2: Update Environment

Replace in `.env.local`:

```env
SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=sbp_NEW_TOKEN_WITH_ALL_SCOPES
```

### Step 3: Test Operations

```bash
# Test these MCP operations:
# - mcp__supabase__list_tables
# - mcp__supabase__get_anon_key
# - mcp__supabase__list_extensions
```

## Expected Token Scopes

For MCP server to work fully, your access token needs:

| Scope                | Required | Purpose                 |
| -------------------- | -------- | ----------------------- |
| `organizations:read` | ✅       | List organizations      |
| `projects:read`      | ✅       | List projects           |
| `projects:write`     | ✅       | Modify project settings |
| `secrets:read`       | ✅       | Read API keys           |
| `secrets:write`      | ❓       | Generate new keys       |
| `database:read`      | ✅       | List tables/extensions  |
| `database:write`     | ❓       | Run migrations          |
| `functions:read`     | ✅       | List edge functions     |
| `functions:write`    | ❓       | Deploy functions        |

## Alternative: Check Current Token Scopes

To verify your current token permissions:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Settings → Access Tokens
3. Find your token `sbp_c47066b04eedb9a43acadef870a35230c59e69f2`
4. Check what scopes are enabled
5. If limited scopes, create new token with full access

## If Still Having Issues

### Option A: Use Service Role Key for Local Development

For local development, you can use the service role key directly:

```env
# Use service role key for MCP operations (local only)
SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=${SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY}
```

### Option B: Contact Supabase Support

If you're definitely the owner but still getting permission errors:

- Check Supabase status page
- Contact Supabase support with your project details

## Next Steps

1. **Create new access token** with ALL scopes
2. **Update `.env.local`** with new token
3. **Test MCP operations** again
4. **Verify full functionality**

The issue is almost certainly scope limitations on your current access token, not account permissions.

---

**Expected Result**: All MCP operations should work once you have a properly scoped access token.
