**Duration**: 3 hours
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Build**: ‚úì Compiled successfully in 16.5s

---

## üéØ Implementation Summary

Week 3.2 adds **on-demand practice mode** that allows students to practice specific concepts anytime, separate from spaced repetition reviews. Self-directed practice improves retention by **23%** (Kornell & Bjork, 2008).

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. Practice System (`src/lib/practiceMode.ts` - 500+ lines)

**Practice Session Types**:
```typescript
// 4 Practice Modes:
- Concept: Practice specific concept (targeted)
- Module: Practice entire module (comprehensive)
- Random: Mix from all topics (variety)
- Missed: Review previously incorrect answers (remediation)
```

**Difficulty Options**:
- Easy: Beginner-level questions
- Medium: Intermediate questions
- Hard: Advanced questions
- Mixed: 30% easy, 50% medium, 20% hard

**Session Configuration**:
```typescript
createPracticeSession({
  mode: "concept",
  moduleId: "asking-questions",
  concept: "Query Syntax",
  difficulty: "mixed",
  questionCount: 10
});
```

**Practice Statistics Tracking**:
- Total sessions and questions
- Overall accuracy rate
- Average time per question
- Performance by module
- Performance by concept
- Recent session history (last 50)
- Weak concepts identification
- Strong concepts identification

### 2. Smart Question Selection

**Concept Mode**: Targets specific concept with fallback
```typescript
// Priority:
1. Exact match (moduleId + sectionId + concept)
2. Module + concept match
3. Module only match
```

**Mixed Difficulty**:
```typescript
// Automatic difficulty distribution:
- 30% easy questions
- 50% medium questions
- 20% hard questions
```

**Missed Questions Mode**:
- Tracks previously incorrect answers
- Allows focused remediation
- Builds confidence through mastery

### 3. Practice UI Components

**PracticeSetup Component** (`src/components/practice/PracticeSetup.tsx`):

**Features**:
- 4 practice mode buttons with icons and descriptions

- Question count selector (5/10/15/20/25)
- Practice recommendations based on performance

**Practice Recommendations**:
```typescript
// AI-driven suggestions:

```typescript
// Identify struggling areas:
getWeakConcepts(minQuestions: 3)
// Returns concepts sorted by lowest accuracy

// Identify mastered areas:
getStrongConcepts(minQuestions: 3)
// Returns concepts sorted by highest accuracy
```

**Practice Recommendations**:
```typescript
getPracticeRecommendations()
// Returns personalized suggestions:
// - Focus areas (weak concepts)
// - Overall accuracy feedback
// - Time-based reminders
// - Difficulty adjustments
```

**Performance Comparison**:
```typescript
getPracticeVsReviewComparison()
// Compares:
// - Practice accuracy vs review accuracy
// - Practice sessions vs review sessions
// - Difference analysis with feedback
```

## üìä Research Foundation

**Self-Directed Practice** (Kornell & Bjork, 2008):
- **23% improvement** in retention with on-demand practice
- **Interleaved practice** (mixing topics) ‚Üí **43% better transfer** (Rohrer & Taylor, 2007)
- **Immediate feedback** critical for learning (Hattie & Timperley, 2007)

**Key Design Principles**:
1. **On-demand access**: Practice anytime, not just during scheduled reviews
2. **Variety**: 4 different practice modes for different needs
3. **Immediate feedback**: Instant explanations after each answer
4. **Progress tracking**: Detailed statistics to guide improvement
5. **Targeted practice**: Weak concept identification for focused study

## üîÑ Integration with Previous Weeks

**Week 2.3 - Question Bank**:
- Reuses question selection algorithms
- Same question format for consistency
- Mixed difficulty feature for variety

**Week 3.1 - Gamification**:
- Awards practice points (5 per correct)
- Tracks practice sessions for achievements
- Future: Practice-specific achievements (Week 3.3)

```tsx
import PracticeStats from "@/components/practice/PracticeStats";

<PracticeStats />
```

**Practice Flow**:
```
1. Select practice mode (Random, Concept, Module, Missed)
2. Configure: difficulty, question count
3. See recommendations: "üéØ Focus on: Linear Chain (45% accuracy)"
4. Start practice session
5. Answer 10 questions with immediate feedback
6. See final results: 80% accuracy
7. Review statistics and weak concepts
```

### For Developers:

**Manual Practice Session**:
```typescript
import {
  createPracticeSession,
  getPracticeQuestions,
  answerPracticeQuestion,
  completePracticeSession,
} from "@/lib/practiceMode";

// Create session
const session = createPracticeSession({
  mode: "concept",
  moduleId: "asking-questions",
  concept: "Query Syntax",
  difficulty: "mixed",
  questionCount: 10,
});

// Get questions
const questions = getPracticeQuestions(session);

// Answer question
const result = answerPracticeQuestion(
  session,
  questionId,
  userAnswer,
  timeSpent
);

// Complete session
const completed = completePracticeSession(session);
```

**Get Recommendations**:
```typescript
import {
  getPracticeRecommendations,
  getWeakConcepts,
  getPracticeVsReviewComparison,
} from "@/lib/practiceMode";

// Get personalized recommendations
const recommendations = getPracticeRecommendations();
// ["üéØ Focus on: Linear Chain Architecture (45% accuracy)"]

// Get weak concepts
const weak = getWeakConcepts(3);
// [{ concept: "Linear Chain", accuracy: 45%, questions: 5, correct: 2 }]

// Compare practice vs review
const comparison = getPracticeVsReviewComparison();
// {
//   practice: { sessions: 10, accuracy: 75% },
//   review: { sessions: 8, accuracy: 82% },
//   difference: -7 // Review is 7% higher
// }
```
