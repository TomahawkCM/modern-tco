## üèóÔ∏è LEARN: Tanium Linear Chain Architecture

### What Makes Tanium Different?

Traditional IT management tools use a **hub-and-spoke** architecture where a central server polls each endpoint individually. This approach:
- ‚ùå Creates massive server load with large environments
- ‚ùå Takes hours or days to gather data from thousands of endpoints
- ‚ùå Requires expensive data warehouses to store historical data
- ‚ùå Provides stale data (often hours or days old)

Tanium's **linear chain architecture** revolutionizes this approach.

### How Linear Chain Works

Instead of the server communicating with every endpoint, Tanium uses a brilliant relay pattern:

1. **Initial Query**: Server sends query to a small number of endpoints (e.g., 10 endpoints)

2. **Exponential Relay**: Each endpoint:
   - Executes the query locally
   - Returns results to whoever asked (server or another endpoint)
   - Forwards the query to other endpoints it knows about

3. **Cascading Coverage**:
   - Round 1: 10 endpoints reached
   - Round 2: 100 endpoints reached (each of 10 contacts 10 more)
   - Round 3: 1,000 endpoints reached
   - Round 4: 10,000 endpoints reached
   - **Total time: ~15 seconds for 15,000 endpoints**

### Visual Representation

```
Server ‚Üí [EP1, EP2, EP3, ... EP10]
           ‚Üì    ‚Üì    ‚Üì         ‚Üì
         10 EPs each forward to 10 more EPs
           ‚Üì    ‚Üì    ‚Üì         ‚Üì
        100 EPs each forward to 10 more EPs
           ‚Üì    ‚Üì    ‚Üì         ‚Üì
      1,000 EPs each forward to 10 more EPs
           ‚Üì    ‚Üì    ‚Üì         ‚Üì
     10,000+ endpoints covered in ~15 seconds
```

### Key Benefits

**Speed**:
- Query 15,000 endpoints in ~15 seconds
- Traditional tools: hours or days

**Scale**:
- Single server can manage 100,000+ endpoints
- Minimal server hardware requirements

**Real-Time Data**:
- No data warehouse needed
- Always current information (not stale snapshots)

**Bandwidth Efficiency**:
- Queries distributed across endpoint network
- Minimal central network congestion

### Real-World Impact

**Security Incident Response Example**:
- Threat detected on one endpoint
- Question: "Which other endpoints have this malware?"
- Traditional tool: 4-6 hours to scan all endpoints
- **Tanium**: 15 seconds to scan 15,000 endpoints
- **Result**: Contain outbreak in minutes instead of hours

{/* Additional sections would follow the same pattern */}

```

## üéØ Key Implementation Details

### 1. Quiz Pass Requirement

```tsx
<MicroSection
  requireQuizPass={true}  // ENFORCES 80% threshold
  quickCheck={<QuickCheckQuiz ... />}
>
  {/* Content */}
</MicroSection>
```

- Student **cannot mark section complete** until passing quiz
- "Mark Complete" button is **locked** until quiz passed
- Visual indicator shows lock icon and requirement

### 2. Quiz Configuration

```tsx
<QuickCheckQuiz
  quizId="unique-quiz-id"
  moduleId="module-id"
  sectionId="section-id"
  sectionTitle="Section Title"
  passThreshold={80}  // Require 80% (4 of 5 questions)
  questions={[...]}
  onPass={() => {
    // Optional: triggered when student passes
  }}
  onFail={() => {
    // Optional: triggered when student fails
  }}
/>
```

### 3. Question Structure

```tsx
{
  id: "unique-question-id",
  question: "The question text?",
  options: [
    "Option A",
    "Option B",
    "Option C",
    "Option D"
  ],
  correctAnswer: "Option B",  // Must match exactly
  explanation: "Detailed explanation of why this is correct...",
  concept: "Concept Tag"  // Used for weak area tracking
}
```

## üìä Data Tracking

### localStorage Keys

**Quiz Pass Status**:
```javascript
`quiz-passed-${moduleId}-${sectionId}` ‚Üí "true" | "false"
```

**Section Completion**:
```javascript
`micro-section-${moduleId}-${sectionId}` ‚Üí "true" | "false"
```

**Quiz Attempts**:
```javascript
`quiz-attempt-${moduleId}-${sectionId}` ‚Üí [
  {
    timestamp: "2025-10-03T20:00:00Z",

    passed: false,
    weakConcepts: ["Linear Chain Architecture", "Query Performance"]
  },
  {
    timestamp: "2025-10-03T20:15:00Z",
    score: 100,
    passed: true,
    weakConcepts: []
  }
]
```

**Weak Areas** (for spaced repetition):
```javascript
`weak-areas-${moduleId}` ‚Üí {
  "Linear Chain Architecture": 2,  // Failed 2 times
  "Server Load Reduction": 1,      // Failed 1 time
  "Query Performance": 3           // Failed 3 times - HIGH PRIORITY
}
```

**Module Progress**:
```javascript
`module-progress-${moduleId}` ‚Üí {
  completedSections: ["section-1", "section-2"],
  lastAccessed: "2025-10-03T20:00:00Z",
  completionPercentage: 40,
