# Spec Kit Initialization Log - TCO Project

**Date**: 2025-01-10  
**Purpose**: Document Spec Kit initialization process and environment verification  
**Status**: Manual initialization due to execution environment constraints

## üö® Environment Issues Discovered

### Python Execution Problems

- **Issue**: Python not accessible via standard commands (`python`, `py`)
- **Environment**: WSL/Git Bash environment with Windows paths
- **Impact**: Cannot execute `specify-cli-working.py` directly
- **Workaround**: Manual Spec Kit process execution

### Node.js Path Issues

- **Issue**: Node.js in PATH but not accessible via standard commands
- **Path Found**: `/mnt/c/Program Files/nodejs/` (Windows path in WSL)
- **Impact**: May affect npm command execution for P0 tasks
- **Priority**: HIGH - blocks development server testing

## ‚úÖ Manual Spec Kit Initialization

Since automated Spec Kit execution is blocked, proceeding with manual initialization based on completed `/specify`, `/plan`, and `/tasks` phases:

### Spec Kit Status

- [x] **Phase 1 (/specify)**: COMPLETED - Requirements defined in `SPEC_KIT_SPECIFY_REQUIREMENTS.md`
- [x] **Phase 2 (/plan)**: COMPLETED - Technical plan created in `SPEC_KIT_PLAN_TECHNICAL.md`
- [x] **Phase 3 (/tasks)**: COMPLETED - Implementation tasks defined in `SPEC_KIT_TASKS_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

## üéØ Immediate Actions Required (P0 Tasks)

Based on the implementation plan, proceeding with critical P0 tasks:

### P0-001: Environment Verification (PRIORITY: CRITICAL)

**Current Status**: BLOCKED - execution environment issues
**Blocking Issues**:

1. Python execution unavailable
2. Node.js path resolution problems
3. PowerShell Core compatibility unknown

**Required Actions**:

1. Resolve Node.js/npm execution in current environment
2. Test PowerShell Core compatibility
3. Verify database connectivity
4. Document working command patterns

### P0-002: Project Functionality Assessment (PRIORITY: CRITICAL)

**Current Status**: PENDING - depends on P0-001 resolution
**Requirements**:

1. Start development server (`npm run dev`)
2. Test all routes and components
3. Verify database connectivity
4. Check browser console for errors
5. Document actual vs claimed functionality

## üîß Environment Troubleshooting

### Command Execution Issues

- **WSL Environment**: Commands expect Unix paths but Windows executables
- **Path Resolution**: Windows program paths not resolving in WSL context
- **PowerShell Integration**: Unknown compatibility with current shell environment

### Potential Solutions

1. **Direct Windows Commands**: Use full Windows paths with proper escaping
2. **PowerShell Execution**: Switch to PowerShell Core for Windows compatibility
3. **Alternative Paths**: Use WSL-native alternatives where available

## üìã Next Steps

### Immediate Priority

1. **Resolve execution environment** to enable P0 task completion
2. **Test development server startup** as first functionality verification
3. **Document working command patterns** for future sessions
4. **Begin systematic functionality assessment** per implementation plan

### Environment-Specific Tasks

- [ ] Test npm commands with full Windows paths
- [ ] Verify PowerShell Core accessibility and compatibility
- [ ] Test database connectivity with current environment
- [ ] Document successful command execution patterns
- [ ] Create environment setup guide for future sessions

## üö¶ Risk Assessment

**HIGH RISK**: Environment execution issues are blocking all P0 tasks, which are prerequisites for subsequent implementation work.

**MITIGATION**: Manual verification and documentation of issues will inform environment setup requirements and guide troubleshooting approach.

**IMPACT**: Delays implementation start but provides critical information about actual project constraints and requirements.

## üîç Complete Environment Assessment Results

### Python Environment Status: ‚ùå BLOCKED

- `python` command: Not accessible
- `py` command: Not accessible
- `python --version`: Not accessible
- **Impact**: Cannot execute Spec Kit CLI directly

### Node.js Environment Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY WORKING

- ‚úÖ npm installation detected: `"C:\Program Files\nodejs\npm.cmd" --version` ‚Üí 10.9.2
- ‚ùå PowerShell PATH issue: All npm bin scripts fail with `node.exe` not recognized
- ‚ùå Development server: Cannot start (`npm run dev` fails)
- ‚ùå Linting tools: Cannot run (`npm run lint` fails)
- ‚ùå TypeScript checking: Cannot run (`npm run typecheck` fails)
- ‚ùå PowerShell-specific scripts: Same PATH issues (`npm run lint:pwsh` fails)

### Critical Technical Issue Identified

**Root Cause**: PowerShell environment PATH configuration does not include Node.js installation directory
**Error Pattern**: `The term 'node.exe' is not recognized as a name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or executable program.`
**Scope**: Affects ALL npm scripts and development tooling

### P0-001 Environment Verification: ‚ö†Ô∏è ASSESSMENT COMPLETE

**Status**: Critical issues documented and verified
**Evidence**: Multiple command execution tests completed with consistent failures
**Resolution Required**: Infrastructure-level PATH configuration fix needed

## üöÄ Resolution Strategy - Testing Command Prompt Alternative

Since PowerShell has PATH issues, testing Command Prompt (cmd) environment as alternative...

### Command Prompt Test Results: ‚ùå FAILED

- `cmd /c "npm --version"`: Shell command failed
- `cmd /c "node --version"`: Shell command failed
- `cmd /c "npm run dev"`: Shell command failed

**Conclusion**: Shell execution appears to be fundamentally blocked in current environment, affecting both PowerShell and Command Prompt.

## üö® CRITICAL ENVIRONMENT ASSESSMENT COMPLETE

### Final Status: INFRASTRUCTURE BLOCKED

**Root Cause**: Fundamental shell command execution failure across all environments
**Scope**: Complete development environment inaccessible
**Impact**: Cannot proceed with ANY P0 implementation tasks

### Evidence Summary

1. ‚úÖ **File System Access**: Full read/write access confirmed
2. ‚ùå **Python Execution**: Completely blocked
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Node.js Detection**: Installation detected but inaccessible
4. ‚ùå **Shell Execution**: All shell commands fail (PowerShell, CMD)
5. ‚ùå **Development Tooling**: Cannot run npm, dev server, linting, testing

### P0-001 Environment Verification: ‚ùå CRITICAL FAILURE

**Status**: COMPLETE - Environment confirmed non-functional for development
**Evidence**: Comprehensive testing across multiple shell environments
**Resolution**: Requires infrastructure-level environment configuration by user

## üìã Spec Kit Status Summary

### Completed Phases ‚úÖ

- [x] **Phase 1 (/specify)**: Requirements analysis complete
- [x] **Phase 2 (/plan)**: Technical planning complete
- [x] **Phase 3 (/tasks)**: Implementation tasks defined
- [x] **Environment Assessment**: Critical issues identified and documented

### Blocked Phases ‚ùå

- [ ] **Implementation**: Cannot proceed until environment resolved
- [ ] **Testing**: Requires functional development environment
- [ ] **Validation**: Depends on working toolchain

### Ready for User Resolution

All documentation complete. Environment issues require user-level infrastructure fixes before Spec Kit implementation can continue.

**Note**: This manual initialization approach maintains Spec Kit methodology while adapting to environmental constraints. All subsequent work will follow the evidence-based approach defined in the implementation tasks.
