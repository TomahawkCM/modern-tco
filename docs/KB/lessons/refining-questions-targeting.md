## Overview

Draft outline for improving question precision through segmentation, filters, and parameterized sensors.

## Learning Objectives

- [ ] Segment endpoints using saved questions and labels.
- [ ] Apply parameter prompts to tune sensor output.
- [ ] Describe how targeting impacts action scoping downstream.

## Lesson Flow

1. Recap of AQ fundamentals.
2. Deep dive on refining sensors using parameter prompts.
3. Targeting lab concept you can build later.

## Resources To Link Later

- Targeting matrix diagrams from product marketing.
- Supabase query examples for saved audiences.
- Link to `domain2-refining-questions.md` once final.

## Author Notes

Focus on practical examples that highlight mistakes to avoid (wildcard overload, stale sensors). Replace placeholders before marking status as `ready`.
