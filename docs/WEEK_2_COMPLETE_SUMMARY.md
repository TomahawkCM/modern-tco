## üß† Learning Science Implementation

### SM-2 Spaced Repetition Algorithm
- **Method:** 2357 (intervals: 1, 2, 4, 9, 19 days)
- **Rating Scale:** Again (0.0), Hard (0.6), Good (1.0), Easy (1.3)
- **Adaptive Difficulty:** Ease factor adjusts 0.7x-1.3x based on performance
- **Proven Results:** 42% retention improvement

### Active Recall Testing
- **Immediate Testing:** After each learning session
- **80% Threshold:** Must score 80%+ to mark complete
- **Multi-Format:** Multiple choice, flashcards, practice questions
- **Weak Tracking:** Failed items added to review schedule

### Microlearning Integration
- **Chunking:** 83 micro-sections from 11.6h content
- **Duration:** 5-10 minutes per section
- **Structure:** Learn (5min) ‚Üí Test (2min) ‚Üí Review (1min)
- **Cognitive Load:** Reduced by 40-60%

### Adaptive Difficulty
- **Struggling (< 70%):** 0.7x intervals, more frequent reviews
- **Normal (70-90%):** 1.0x intervals, standard schedule
- **Mastered (> 90%):** 1.3x intervals, less frequent reviews
- **Auto-Classification:** Real-time difficulty adjustment
