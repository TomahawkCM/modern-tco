# TCO Question Bank Validation Recommendations

**Date:** August 30, 2025  
**Validator:** TCO Validation Expert  
**Priority:** IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

## üö® Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

### Issue #1: TypeScript Compilation Failures

**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** System cannot function properly  
**Root Cause:** Missing `category` property in legacy questions

**Immediate Fix Required:**

```typescript
// In src/data/sample-questions.ts - Add category to each legacy question
{
  id: 'legacy-001',
  question: 'What is the primary purpose of the Tanium Client?',
  // ... existing properties ...
  category: QuestionCategory.PLATFORM_FUNDAMENTALS, // ADD THIS LINE
}
```

**Recommended Categories by Question Type:**

- Basic Tanium concepts ‚Üí `PLATFORM_FUNDAMENTALS`
- Step-by-step procedures ‚Üí `CONSOLE_PROCEDURES`
- Problem-solving scenarios ‚Üí `TROUBLESHOOTING`
- Real-world applications ‚Üí `PRACTICAL_SCENARIOS`
- Tanium architecture ‚Üí `LINEAR_CHAIN`

### Issue #2: Import Declaration Conflicts

**Severity:** HIGH  
**Location:** src/data/sample-questions.ts line 4 and 38
**Fix:** Resolve duplicate `questionBankMetadata` declarations

```typescript
// Remove duplicate export and use single source
export const questionBankMetadata = combinedQuestionBankMetadata; // Keep only this line
```

## üìä Domain-Specific Recommendations

### Taking Action Domain (Currently Under-represented)

**Target:** Add 8-10 questions  
**Focus Areas:**

1. **Package Deployment Scenarios**

```typescript
{
  id: 'action-new-001',
  question: 'When deploying a package to 10,000 endpoints during a security incident, what is the recommended batch size to prevent network saturation?',
  choices: [
    { id: 'a', text: 'Deploy to all 10,000 simultaneously for speed' },
    { id: 'b', text: 'Use batches of 500 endpoints with 2-minute intervals' },
    { id: 'c', text: 'Use batches of 1,000 endpoints with 5-minute intervals' },
    { id: 'd', text: 'Deploy manually to avoid network issues' }
  ],
  correctAnswerId: 'b',
  domain: TCODomain.TAKING_ACTION,
  difficulty: Difficulty.ADVANCED,
  category: QuestionCategory.PRACTICAL_SCENARIOS,
  explanation: 'For large-scale critical deployments, smaller batches (500) with brief intervals prevent network saturation while maintaining rapid deployment speed.',
  consoleSteps: [
    'Create computer groups of 500 endpoints each',
    'Deploy to first batch via Deploy module',
    'Monitor success rate (should be >95%)',
    'Wait 2 minutes for network recovery',
    'Deploy to next batch if previous successful'
  ]
}
```

2. **Approval Workflow Management**
3. **Emergency Response Procedures**
4. **Package Parameter Configuration**

### Connect Module Enhancement

**Target:** Add 5-6 questions  
**Focus Areas:**

1. **SIEM Integration Complexity**
2. **Real-time vs Batch Data Export**
3. **External API Integration**
4. **Data Format Transformation**

---

## üéØ Difficulty Level Rebalancing

### Convert Beginner to Intermediate (10-15 questions)

**Criteria for Conversion:**

- Questions that require applied knowledge, not just memorization
- Multi-step procedures
- Conditional scenarios ("What if..." situations)

**Example Conversion:**

```typescript
// BEFORE (Beginner)
question: "What port does Tanium use for client communication?";
// Simple fact recall

// AFTER (Intermediate)
question: "A Tanium Client cannot connect to the server. The firewall shows blocked traffic on port 17472. What should be your first troubleshooting step?";
// Applied knowledge with troubleshooting context
```

### Create Advanced Questions (5-10 questions)

**Advanced Characteristics:**

- Multi-component system interactions
- Complex troubleshooting scenarios
- Performance optimization decisions
- Security incident response
- Cross-module workflow integration

**Advanced Question Template:**

```typescript
{
  id: 'advanced-new-001',
  question: 'During a security incident, your Tanium deployment shows degraded performance with 30% of endpoints not responding to questions within the 120-second timeout. You need to rapidly deploy a forensics package to all responsive endpoints while maintaining system stability. What is your optimal strategy?',
  choices: [
    { id: 'a', text: 'Increase timeout to 300 seconds and deploy to all endpoints' },
    { id: 'b', text: 'Deploy immediately to responsive endpoints only, then address non-responsive endpoints separately' },
    { id: 'c', text: 'Create dynamic computer group of responsive endpoints and deploy in 500-endpoint batches' },
    { id: 'd', text: 'Wait for full system recovery before deploying any packages' }
  ],
  correctAnswerId: 'c',
  domain: TCODomain.TAKING_ACTION,
  difficulty: Difficulty.ADVANCED,
  category: QuestionCategory.PRACTICAL_SCENARIOS,
  explanation: 'Advanced incident response requires balancing speed with system stability. Dynamic grouping of responsive endpoints with batched deployment ensures rapid forensics deployment without overwhelming an already degraded system.',
  tags: ['incident-response', 'performance-optimization', 'dynamic-targeting', 'forensics']
}
```

## üè∑Ô∏è Category Enhancement Recommendations

### Console Procedures Category

**Issue:** Questions categorized as console procedures lack step-by-step instructions  
**Solution:** Add `consoleSteps` array to all procedural questions

**Template for Console Steps:**

```typescript
consoleSteps: [
  "Navigate to [Module] > [Section]",
  "Click [Button/Action]",
  "Configure [specific settings]",
  "Verify [expected result]",
  "Save/Apply changes",
];
```

### Linear Chain Architecture Category

**Current Status:** ‚úÖ Well covered  
**Enhancement:** Add 1-2 more questions on:

- Linear chain troubleshooting
- Performance optimization in chain networks
- Multi-subnet chain configuration

---

## üîß Technical Implementation Fixes

### Priority 1: TypeScript Resolution

**File:** `src/data/sample-questions.ts`
**Required Changes:**

1. Add `category` property to all legacy questions (lines 42-309)
2. Resolve duplicate `questionBankMetadata` exports
3. Ensure proper type imports

### Priority 2: Question Interface Compliance

**Files:** Various question data files  
**Required Changes:**

1. Ensure all questions implement complete `Question` interface
2. Add missing optional properties where appropriate
3. Validate choice array structure

### Priority 3: Enhanced Metadata

**Enhancement Areas:**

1. **Study Guide References:** Add `studyGuideRef` to all questions
2. **Official References:** Include `officialRef` where available
3. **Tag Standardization:** Implement consistent tagging scheme

**Recommended Tag Categories:**

- **Functional:** `question-syntax`, `sensors`, `packages`, `rbac`
- **Procedural:** `console-navigation`, `configuration`, `deployment`
- **Contextual:** `troubleshooting`, `performance`, `security`
- **Difficulty:** `basic-concepts`, `applied-knowledge`, `complex-scenarios`

## üìà Quality Assurance Enhancements

### Explanation Quality Standards

**Current:** Variable quality  
**Target:** Consistent, comprehensive explanations

**Enhanced Explanation Template:**

```typescript
explanation: `
[Correct answer confirmation]
[Why other options are incorrect]
[Additional context/best practices]
[Reference to official documentation]
`;
```

**Example Enhanced Explanation:**

```typescript
explanation: 'The "Uptime" sensor shows how long a system has been running since last reboot, making it ideal for identifying machines with extended uptime that may need patching or maintenance. The "Last Reboot" sensor shows the timestamp of the last reboot, which requires date calculations. "System Status" is too general, and "Boot Time" is not a standard Tanium sensor. For security compliance, machines should typically be rebooted monthly for patch installation.';
```

### Console Steps Enhancement

**Target:** All procedural questions should include detailed navigation steps  
**Format:** Array of step-by-step instructions
