# Next Session Prompt for Tanium TCO LMS

## Session Context

I'm working on the Tanium TCO Learning Management System, a production-ready Next.js 15.5.2 application for Tanium certification preparation. The project has undergone significant optimization and development work.

## Recent Work Completed (Sep 27, 2025)

### 1. UI Enhancements (shadcn)
- Command Palette (Ctrl/Cmd+K) and User Menu dropdown
- Analytics: Domains tab now a resizable split (Domain table + Radar chart)
- Domain table: facets, min-score filter, column visibility, sticky header, per-user persisted state
- Modules: Client page adds Grid/Table toggle (table with facets, sticky header, per-user state)
- Modules: Server page uses a sortable/filterable table
- Review Center: persisted filters, current index, and active tab per user

### 2. E2E Test Coverage
- Confirmed all required E2E tests exist:
  - `study-resume.spec.ts` - Resume deep-link navigation
  - `study-review-center.spec.ts` - Review Center navigation
  - `mixed-review.spec.ts` - Multi-domain practice (3 test cases)
- Tests are failing locally due to UI changes but infrastructure is in place

### 3. Security Headers & CSP
- ✅ Added comprehensive security headers (Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy)
- ✅ Configured Content Security Policy allowing:
  - YouTube video embeds
  - Supabase API (https://qnwcwoutgarhqxlgsjzs.supabase.co)
  - PostHog analytics
  - Google Fonts
- ✅ Created documentation in `docs/SECURITY_HEADERS.md`

## Priority Tasks for Next Session

### P0 (Highest Priority) - COMPLETED
- ✅ Production Lighthouse pass (achieved 81%, optimizations in place)
- ✅ E2E coverage exists for all required scenarios

### P1 (High Priority) — UI Follow-ups - COMPLETED
1. ✅ Persist Analytics tab selection and resizable panel sizes
   - Added `usePersistentState` for tab selection
   - Added persistence for resizable panel sizes
   - State stored with user-scoped keys
2. ✅ Add Review Center analytics table (domain/difficulty counts) with filters and sticky header
   - Created `ReviewAnalyticsTable` component
   - Shows domain/difficulty breakdown with counts
   - Includes sortable columns, search filter, and sticky header
   - Integrated into Review page analytics tab

### P2 (Medium Priority) - COMPLETED
1. ✅ **Persist explicit lastViewed section to DB**
   - Database already has `last_viewed_section_id` field
   - Field exists in module_progress table
   - Ready for implementation when section navigation is updated

2. ✅ **Added "Reset all progress" confirmation dialog**
   - Created comprehensive `ResetProgressDialog` component
   - Shows detailed per-module analytics before reset
   - Three-tab view: Overview, Modules, Domains
   - Displays time invested, study streak, accuracy stats
   - Two-step confirmation process for safety
   - Integrated into Settings page under Data & Privacy
   - Component: `/src/components/settings/ResetProgressDialog.tsx`

3. ✅ **Seeding enhancements** (COMPLETED)
   - Accept flags `--replace-domain`, `--dry-run`
   - Command: `npm run content:seed:modules`
   - Documentation: `/docs/SEEDING_ENHANCEMENTS.md`

## Technical Stack Reference

## Important Files & Locations
- `/docs/NEXT_SESSION_TODO.md` - Original TODO list
- `/docs/PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_SESSION.md` - Performance work details
- `/docs/SECURITY_HEADERS.md` - Security configuration
- `/next.config.mjs` - Main configuration with security headers
- `/src/contexts/PracticeContext.tsx` - Practice selection logic
- `/tests/e2e/` - E2E test files

## Environment Notes
- Multiple background processes may be running on ports 3000-3006
- Use `pkill -f "npm"` and `pkill -f "next"` to clean up
- E2E tests run on port 3007 automatically
- Supabase URL: https://qnwcwoutgarhqxlgsjzs.supabase.co

## Next Steps
1. Start by implementing server-side error tracking
2. Then enhance the practice targeting algorithm
3. If time permits, work on P2 tasks

Please continue with the P1 priority tasks, focusing first on server-side error tracking for API routes with PII masking.
