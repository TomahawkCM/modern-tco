```typescript
// Add category to each legacy question
category: QuestionCategory.PLATFORM_FUNDAMENTALS, // or appropriate category
```

### 2. TypeScript Compilation Errors

**Impact:** HIGH  
**Count:** 50+ errors  
**Critical Issues:**

- Missing properties in Question interface implementations
- Type mismatches in component props
- Import declaration conflicts

### 3. Explanation Quality

**Assessment:** GOOD overall  
**Issues Found:**
