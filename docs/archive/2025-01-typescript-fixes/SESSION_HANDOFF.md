# SESSION HANDOFF - Tanium TCO Console Error Fixes

## üö® CRITICAL CURRENT STATE

**‚úÖ CONFIRMED WORKING:**

- Application is running on **localhost:3007**
- Mock exam implementation is complete (90-minute timer, auto-submit)
- Phase 4 functionality exists but needs console error cleanup

**‚ùå NEEDS FIXING:**

- Console errors preventing clean operation
- Warnings that may affect user experience

## üéØ IMMEDIATE PRIORITY: CONSOLE ERROR FIXES

### MANDATORY TESTING PROTOCOL

**NEVER ASSUME - ALWAYS VERIFY:**

1. ‚úÖ App is already running on port 3007 - DO NOT START BROWSERS
2. ‚úÖ Navigate to <http://localhost:3007> in ONE browser tab
3. ‚úÖ Open DevTools ‚Üí Console tab IMMEDIATELY
4. ‚úÖ Document EXACT error messages before any fixes
5. ‚úÖ Fix one error at a time with verification

### CONSOLE ERROR FIXING CHECKLIST

#### Step 1: Document Current Errors

- [ ] Navigate to localhost:3007
- [ ] Open DevTools ‚Üí Console tab
- [ ] Screenshot or copy ALL red errors with exact messages
- [ ] Screenshot or copy ALL yellow warnings with exact messages
- [ ] Note which pages/actions trigger each error

#### Step 2: Fix Errors One by One

- [ ] Identify the specific file causing each error
- [ ] Make targeted edit to fix ONLY that error
- [ ] Refresh page and verify error is gone
- [ ] Do NOT read unnecessary files
- [ ] Move to next error only after current one is fixed

#### Step 3: Verify Clean Console

- [ ] Navigate through entire app (homepage, mock exam, practice mode)
- [ ] Confirm zero red errors in console
- [ ] Confirm zero yellow warnings in console
- [ ] Test mock exam start ‚Üí timer ‚Üí navigation ‚Üí completion

## üö´ PROHIBITED ACTIONS (WASTE TIME/TOKENS)

- ‚ùå Starting multiple browsers or browser automation
- ‚ùå Switching ports (3007 is confirmed working)
- ‚ùå Reading unnecessary files to "understand architecture"
- ‚ùå Marking todos complete without actual verification
- ‚ùå Assuming functionality works based on code analysis
- ‚ùå Making changes without testing them in browser

## ‚úÖ SUCCESS CRITERIA

**Console Error Fixes Complete When:**

- [ ] Zero red errors in DevTools Console on localhost:3007
- [ ] Zero yellow warnings in DevTools Console
- [ ] Mock exam flow works without console errors
- [ ] All pages load cleanly without JavaScript errors
- [ ] Timer functionality works in browser testing

## üìù ERROR TRACKING TEMPLATE

```
ERROR #1:
- Exact Message: [copy from console]
- File/Line: [from console stack trace]
- Trigger: [what action causes this error]
- Status: [ ] Not Fixed [ ] Fixed [ ] Verified

ERROR #2:
- Exact Message: [copy from console]
- File/Line: [from console stack trace]
- Trigger: [what action causes this error]
- Status: [ ] Not Fixed [ ] Fixed [ ] Verified
```

## üîç KNOWN ISSUES FROM PREVIOUS SESSION

Based on previous session, likely console errors include:

- MDX loader domain mapping issues
- Supabase connection errors (may be expected with fallback)
- Routing or component loading issues

**BUT: Document actual errors from console, not assumptions**

## üìä PROGRESS TRACKING

- **Session Start**: 2025-09-09 (Session Continuation)
- **Errors Found**: TBD (Cannot access app yet)
- **Errors Fixed**: 0
- **Status**: BLOCKED - Development Server Won't Start
- **Next Session Notes**: Server startup issues need resolution

## üö® CURRENT SESSION STATUS - SERVER STARTUP ISSUES

**‚ùå BLOCKING ISSUE**: Development server will not start on any port

**ATTEMPTED SOLUTIONS**:

- ‚úÖ Tried npm run dev:port (port 3007)
- ‚úÖ Tried npm run dev (default port 3000)
- ‚úÖ Tried dev.bat startup script
- ‚úÖ Tried direct Node.js execution with full path
- ‚úÖ Checked both port 3000 and 3007 - no servers running
- ‚úÖ Confirmed package.json scripts exist
- ‚ùå All command executions fail with "Shell command failed"

**LIKELY CAUSE**: Node.js/npm environment issues in current session

**IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**:

1. **Environment Diagnosis**: Check if Node.js/npm are properly accessible
2. **Manual Server Start**: Try alternative startup methods
3. **Port Check**: Verify no other processes blocking ports
4. **Dependencies Check**: Ensure node_modules are properly installed

**CANNOT PROCEED WITH CONSOLE ERROR FIXES UNTIL SERVER IS RUNNING**

## üîß RECOMMENDED RESOLUTION STEPS FOR NEXT SESSION

**ENVIRONMENT SETUP REQUIRED**:

1. **Manual Environment Check**:
   - Verify Node.js is installed and accessible from command line
   - Check if PATH environment variable includes Node.js/npm
   - Confirm working directory permissions

2. **Alternative Startup Methods**:
   - Try opening separate terminal/PowerShell window
   - Navigate to modern-tco directory manually
   - Run `npm install` first if needed
   - Try `npm run dev:port` or `npm run dev`

3. **Port Verification**:
   - Check if any services are blocking ports 3000 or 3007
   - Use `netstat -an | findstr :3007` to check port usage

4. **Fallback Options**:
   - Use Visual Studio Code integrated terminal
   - Try Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) if available
   - Consider using dev.bat from Windows Explorer

**ONCE SERVER IS RUNNING, RETURN TO ORIGINAL PROTOCOL**:

- Navigate to <http://localhost:3007> (or active port)
- Open DevTools ‚Üí Console tab
- Document exact error messages
- Fix errors one by one with verification

**REMEMBER: This session focus is ONLY console error fixes. No feature additions, no architecture changes, no assumptions - just clean console operation.**
