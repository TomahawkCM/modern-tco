## 7. Recommendations

### Immediate Actions: **None Required**

‚úÖ System is performing excellently and is production-ready.

### Optional Optimizations

1. **Increase Swap Space (Low Priority)**
   - Current: 8GB
   - Recommended: 16GB
   - Benefit: Extra safety for extreme memory spikes
   - Impact: Minimal (swap rarely used)
   - **Action:** Edit `.wslconfig`, set `swap=16GB`, run `wsl --shutdown`

2. **Build Time Optimization (Very Low Priority)**
   - Current: 66.8s
   - Target: 40-60s
   - Gap: 6.8-26.8s
   - **Potential actions:**
     - Enable incremental builds (already active)
     - Reduce static page pre-rendering (trade-off: slower first load)
     - Enable experimental compiler options
   - **Recommendation:** **Do not optimize** - current performance is excellent for project scale

3. **Monitor HMR Performance**
   - Expected: <100ms
   - Status: Not measured in this test
   - **Action:** Manually test hot reload during development
   - **How:** Edit `src/app/page.tsx`, observe browser update time

### Long-Term Monitoring

**Track these metrics over time:**

- Dev server startup time (should stay <5s)
- Build time (should stay <90s)
- Memory usage during builds (should stay <10GB)
- HMR performance (should stay <200ms)

**Warning signs to watch for:**

- Dev startup >10s (investigate Turbopack cache)
- Build time >120s (investigate type/component complexity)
- Memory errors during builds (increase heap size)
- Swap usage >1GB (investigate memory leaks)
