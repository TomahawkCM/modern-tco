## üß† Research-Backed Design

### Hands-On Learning Effectiveness

**Research Foundation:**
- **Practice retrieval improves retention by 50%** (Roediger & Karpicke, 2006)
- **Immediate feedback increases learning by 20-25%** (Hattie & Timperley, 2007)
- **Scaffolded learning reduces cognitive load by 40%** (van Merri√´nboer & Sweller, 2005)

**Design Principles:**
- **Learning by Doing**: Active practice vs passive reading
- **Immediate Validation**: Instant feedback on every step
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Beginner ‚Üí Intermediate ‚Üí Advanced
- **Scaffolded Support**: Hints available when needed
- **Safe Practice Environment**: No risk of breaking actual Tanium console

### Hint System Psychology

**4-Level Hint Progression:**
1. **Gentle (Low Penalty)**: Nudge in right direction without answer
2. **Specific (Medium Penalty)**: Point to exact location/feature
3. **Detailed (High Penalty)**: Step-by-step procedure
4. **Solution (Highest Penalty)**: Complete answer revealed

**Benefits:**
- **Promotes Persistence**: Students try before seeking help
- **Metacognition**: Students assess own knowledge gaps
- **Gradual Support**: Hints escalate only when needed
- **Point System**: Encourages minimal hint usage
