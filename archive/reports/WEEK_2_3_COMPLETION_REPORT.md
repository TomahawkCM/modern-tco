## üìä System Architecture

### Database Functions (PostgreSQL)
```sql
-- Get comprehensive review statistics
get_review_stats(user_id)
‚Üí Returns: flashcards_due, questions_due, streak, retention, etc.

-- Get prioritized review queue (flashcards + questions)
get_unified_review_queue(user_id, limit)
‚Üí Returns: Combined queue sorted by priority_score

-- Calculate consecutive day streak
calculate_review_streak(user_id)
‚Üí Returns: Current streak count
```
