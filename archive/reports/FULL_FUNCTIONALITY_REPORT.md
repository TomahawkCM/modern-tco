## üìã EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Current State
The Modern Tanium TCO LMS represents a **sophisticated enterprise-grade learning platform** with advanced features including:
- Next.js 15.5.2 + TypeScript architecture with 11+ React contexts
- Supabase PostgreSQL with real-time features and RLS security
- shadcn/ui components with accessibility compliance
- Comprehensive assessment engine with weighted scoring
- Multi-provider video integration system

### Critical Finding
**While the technical platform is enterprise-ready, the educational content has significant gaps that prevent effective zero-to-hero TCO certification preparation.**

### Key Metrics
- **Official Exam Requirement**: ~15-20 hours of comprehensive study content
- **Current Content Coverage**: ~7 hours actual usable content (major imbalances)
- **Hands-on Practice**: 2 of 15+ referenced labs exist
- **Video Learning**: 0 videos despite complete video system infrastructure
- **Foundation Content**: Missing entirely (2-4 hours needed for zero-knowledge students)

### Bottom Line
**The platform is technically superior but educationally incomplete for its intended purpose.**
